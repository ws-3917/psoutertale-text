msgid "But alas, {^3}his fate was sealed, {^3}and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "No addendum to the story could unravel it."
msgstr ""

msgid "There was no scenario in which the player could truly be satisfied."
msgstr ""

msgid "Is this what they really deserve?"
msgstr ""

msgid "To live in bittersweet agony, {^3}knowing he could never be..."
msgstr ""

msgid "No...{^5}\nI will not allow it."

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* oh......\n* did i get in your way......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ... huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You repeat the secret told to you by Napstablook in Archive Six.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* a magic trick...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* wait, i think i know what they were referring to..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* let me try..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* oh no......\n* i did, didn't i........."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* sorry..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* force of habit......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* i'll...\n* get out of your way now......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* if you need anything... i'll be outside, i guess"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* well, cya........."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* oooooooooooo......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* this is so nice......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (...)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* (You feel... something.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* oh, sorry... i should probably explain what this is..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... so..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* i took your body...\n* as a vessel..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* and now...... we inhabit the same space......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* neat, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* i don't know why, but... the last human who tried this really liked it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* so... maybe you will, too"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* well... we can stay like this as long as you don't try to move."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* so...\n* only try to move around when you want me to stop, i guess."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* thanks, frisk......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* i'll be back later, okay?"
msgstr ""

msgid "* (Are you ready to go outside?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes"
msgstr "是"

msgid "No"
msgstr "否"

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (But you didn't feel like wasting your time here.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* The computer's offline, but there's an empty slot for a computer chip."
msgstr ""

msgid "* (Insert the Computer Chip?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You decide not to insert.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Ah!\n* Thank you!\n* Thank you so much!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You really took care of me!\n* You have found a computer very far away indeed!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ..."
msgstr "<32>* ..."

msgid "<32>* I have established a link between this computer and my body on the Outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I never could have imagined how it would feel to exist in two places at once!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It is... incredible..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I shall not forget this deed, fellow traveler!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Thank you, fellow traveler.\n* I owe you my future."

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Sorry, kiddo.\n* We're still out here building the front yard."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And the front door."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* If you're looking for Asgore, he's out here with us."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* We'll be done in a few hours, so just sit tight for now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Just a few more hours, kiddo."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Then you can come out."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* A few more hours."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* So this is your room, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Kind of strange..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... but who am I kidding, this is you we're talking about."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You'd sleep in a doggy bed if you had the choice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And you'd eat the dog food."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And you'd like it if somebody tried to pet you whilst eating said dog food."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I'd offer you a treat, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Even with my new ability to appear physically, I'm still just a ghost."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You'll have to settle for ghost dog treats, I'm afraid."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Oh, right.\n* My new ability."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I tried showing myself to Asriel like before, but he couldn't see me..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* So it looks like it only works for you right now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Still.\n* Better than nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* At least you can actually walk up to and talk to me now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Like that, for example."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Or that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Or even that!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* You can stop now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* There's more to your room than me, isn't there?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Maybe not."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Maybe I'm all you've got."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* In which case..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* We'll be here for a long time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* A very long time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* A very, very long time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* A very, very long time indeed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Don't you have anything better to do?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Ah, the humble hallway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* For Asriel and I, it was the starting point of countless adventures..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* ... running dauntlessly across the various rooms of the house."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I know, right?\n* So very adventurous."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Sadly, we had to stop after the mirror got smashed in for the seven hundredth time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You wouldn't believe the excuses I'd come up with..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* Like when I blamed a particle collider for shooting a stray atom from Earth to the outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* And somehow only hitting the glass because it \"phased\" through the wall."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Yeah... that one might've been a stretch."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Nowadays, though, hallways are just hallways."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And excuses are just excuses."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Is there a valuable life lesson in there somewhere?\n* Probably."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I will say, there's a kind of symbolism to a ghost in a hallway..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* With the whole \"between one place and another\" thing going on."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Actually, that probably only applies to human ghosts."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Monster ghosts are just born like that naturally..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* So, if anything, they'd be in the room at the beginning of the hallway..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... rather than standing in the middle of it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Sorry.\n* Went on a tangent there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But what did you expect me to go on when you spoke to me in a boring hallway?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* Boring hallway, boring tangent.\n* That makes sense, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Or maybe it doesn't.\n* What do I know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Apart from the fact that I've run out of things to say."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* That, I know for sure."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But what can you do?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ... wait, I know!\n* We could go to a new room!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Ooh... Asgore's room."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The big guy sure loves his diaries, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Even though he hasn't written anything into that one yet, I'm sure he'll do so soon."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Reading them has always been a guilty pleasure of mine..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* What?\n* Everyone's got some kind of guilty pleasure, don't they?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I wonder what yours would be..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Maybe I'll find out later."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* For now, though, I'll just be hanging around."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Watching, waiting..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... ready to catch you the moment you do something you don't want me to see!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Okay, maybe I wouldn't actually go that far."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>{#p/basic}* Not while you're awake, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I took a peek outside, and they're STILL working on construction."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The whole front of the house is STILL a big mess."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And Asgore's... STILL tending to the ground..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... while the former CORE workers take their sweet, sweet time building the porch."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I wonder what it'll look like when it's done..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Hopefully, with Asgore in charge, it'll look better than what we've had before."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Actually, Asgore's only in charge of the design."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Since construction started yesterday, Doge has been the one giving the orders."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I snuck outside then, too."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* She's strict, but she seems to know what she's doing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Which is great, because as much as I love Asgore for who he is..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He most certainly is NOT your ideal foreman."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>{#p/basic}* Speaking of things being built, they finished the balcony earlier this morning."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Monster Kid and Asriel are both outside...\n* ... sightseeing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* They sure do that a lot together... they're probably waiting for you to join them."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Once you're done taking in YOUR surroundings, you could go see them."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* Or you could just go back to your room.\n* Whatever floats your hoverboat."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Oh yeah, about boats..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I guess those aren't really needed around here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But... Frisk!\n* There are places on this world you can't be without one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Especially the bog basins.\n* All that murky water..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Just keep it in mind."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* And no, you can't just get by swimming in those kinds of places."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* Only some of them.\n* And only at a good time of day."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Mind you, do monsters even have a sense of the time of day?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Most WERE born in space..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ... maybe that's a question for another time of day."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Three little chairs at the dining table..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* One for you, one for Asriel, and one for Monster Kid."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That's fine, really.\n* Asgore wouldn't know I'm here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Still..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It does feel strange not to have a place there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Asriel and I loved to swap the chairs around when Mom wasn't looking."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Even Asgore would get in on it sometimes.\n* She... wasn't impressed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But it was all in good fun."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Heck, he used to check under Asriel's chair for space creatures when he sat down."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'll never forget that time Toriel sat down on the chair, which we swapped beforehand..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* Asgore gave her the exact same treatment, and it was GLORIOUS."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* All of us were laughing... except for Toriel, who sat there in disbelief."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Well.\n* She came around to it later."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But, yeah... she wasn't much for the chicanery we got up to."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And even if she won't be here all the time..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And although she probably won't visit here much at all..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's a good thing Asriel's got someone like you to calm him down."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* When he gets excited, he gets REALLY excited."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... or, used to, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I guess it's unfair to think of him as the same person he once was."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* With all that stuff he mentioned about trying to corrupt you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* With all that stuff he mentioned about hurting you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He's probably a very different person by now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Not unlike myself."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I just hope he can make the best of what he has, now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And that you'll be there for him when he needs you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But I guess I'm starting to repeat myself."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* We've got a home, we've got sunlight... so there's no reason to complain!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... or something like that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Of course they put a microwave in here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Of course they did."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* No doubt that'll be Asriel's primary source of food."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Yeah, he's what you'd call a \"microwave master.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I mean, it's bad enough that so many of our ingredients are replicated these days..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Formed with matter-energy conversion nonsense, rather than legitimate cooking."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But at least that can still produce something palletable."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Using the microwave is just..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's wrong."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's so very wrong."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>{#p/basic}* I mean, that's just my opinion."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You can feel free to disagree, and knowing you, you probably do..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But some opinions..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Let's just say some opinions are more correct than others."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* All we can hope for is that Eurybia has a better selection of fresh ingredients."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Considering Alphys was the one to seek out planets in the first place..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You can't blame me for being at least a little wary."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>{#p/basic}* If Asriel's a microwave master, Alphys would be a microwave overlord."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That's all I'm saying."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* No, really."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Won't say anything more."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Not in the kitchen, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* The balcony's just outside..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I wonder if the birds are saying anything interesting."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* Like \"what a nice house!\"\n* Or \"the weather's great today.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Maybe they don't like the house OR the weather.\n* That'd be... kind of sad."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Maybe they're not even birds.\n* Who knows what kinds of sounds birds make here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Who knows if birds even exist here at all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* For all we know, what we're hearing are the cries of the damned buried deep underground."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* After the monsters have lived here long enough, the planet might gain some form of magic."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* If that happens, would the animals be affected, too?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Would they become conscious?\n* Understand us?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Would we understand them?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* If the sounds we're hearing really ARE cries of the damned, I'm not sure I'd want to know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But yeah, planetary magic."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I think that's what happened to Krios, when monsters first gained THEIR magic."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Either that, or the planet already had magic, and gave it to them."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* We'd have to ask Terrestria about that sort of thing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* She'd know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Hey.\n* Don't be nervous about going out there, Frisk."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'm sure those two would be happy to see you there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And if my analysis of the position is right..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The planet itself will, too."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Don't quote me on that, though."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'm not much of a chess player."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* The smartest move I've ever played in a board game was a double-jump in checkers."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It was downhill from there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* And it might be downhill from here, too, if we weren't buried in a jungle."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Not that I blame Asgore for choosing such a low-risk location."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He's got two adopted children to think about now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Not to mention his own son."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Mountainside living might be cool, but the jungle has its own appeal, too."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Righty-o.\n* The bathroom."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The bathroom, the bathroom, the bathroom..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Bathroom bathroom bathroom bathroom bathroom."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Bathroom."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Bathroom!!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Okay... I will admit."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It is pretty cool that you've got extra-fluffy shampoo."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Even if it doesn't actually make sense for a human to have it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Unless... you ARE turning into a goat..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... baaah?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* There's a distinct possibility you are not the only one who uses this bathroom."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* So this is Monster Kid and Asriel's room..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I don't have much to say."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Though... that poster on the wall is pretty cool."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The old homeworld..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Only now, it's in sepia tone."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I'm honestly not surprised he made this room so much smaller than yours."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He knows monsters very well.\n* If the bed's comfortable, who cares what room it's in?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Not monsters, that's who!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That must be why Asriel slept in your bed last night as opposed to his."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* From what I can tell..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* This room belonged to someone who spent a long time doing one specific thing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* If I had that kind of free time, I have no idea what I'd do."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I do know I wouldn't spend it on such a tedious and demoralizingly-large project."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But I'm not them, so I wouldn't know what goes through their head."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/1}* Is THIS what living on a planet is like?\n* This is INCREDIBLE!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/3}* ... haha."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* We'll just have to explore it to find out!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/7}* Wait..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* What if the two of us formed a group or something?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* We'd explore everything here, and then go to other worlds..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Then, with Dr. Alphys's wormholes, we can even go to other galaxies!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* When we're done, we'll have a map of the whole galaxy!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/13}* And we should TOTALLY have a secret handshake!\n* Like Gerson's!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/2}* Man, I can't wait..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* You and I are gonna do EVERYTHING together!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/10}* What?\n* A whole planet of this?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/20}* Pfft.\n* This is nothing..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* Just past the forest, there's a giant mountain..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* And a lake beyond that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/2}* That must be the lake with that slimy red goo..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Gross AND awesome!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/1}* ... I dare you to swim."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/7}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* Deal.\n* But only if you swim WITH me!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/21}* Uh... I mean..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/20}* Maybe we'd be better off if we stuck to dune racing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/6}* You're not afraid of getting sticky red goo all over you, are you?"
msgstr ""

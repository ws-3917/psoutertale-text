msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/16}* ... right."

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I didn't understand it back then, but..."

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* No.\n* Not anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* People CAN change, Asriel..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Isn't that what you always believed?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* ... I still do."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I've spent the past hundred years wallowing in self-pity."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I've spent the past hundred years holding a grudge I never should've had."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* In all that time, I wondered what kept me alive..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And now, I finally know the answer."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/15}* ...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ... it's you, Asriel."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You're the one who's been keeping me alive."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Think of it like... an unfulfilled promise."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Holding that grudge... thinking about you in the way that I did..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Knowing I could've been so much more for you than I ultimately was."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* All this time, that's what's been holding me back."

msgid "<32>* He's still in there, isn't he?"

msgid "<32>* Like a little angel..."

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/23}* Ha... I thought I'd lost you for a minute there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/22}* Don't scare me like that again, okay?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* Well...\n* I have my SOUL back inside of me now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* My original one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/16}* When $(name) and I died, they must've wrapped their SOUL around it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* ... keeping it safe until it could be returned to me here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/17}* They held on that whole time, just for a chance to see me, Frisk..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* ... so, the least I can do is honor it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* Live the life they always wanted me to have."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/23}* ... Frisk."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/23}* I'm going to stay with you from now on."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* Wherever you go... I'll follow you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* I feel like...\n* I can trust you with that sort of thing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* Even if we don't know much about each other."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* ... I don't know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* Frisk... are you really sure about this?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* All the times I've hurt you, hurt your friends..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/22}* It's... all I can think about right now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/21}* Seeing them die like that in my mind, over and over..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/22}* Knowing that I'm the one who did it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* Are you really sure you can live with someone like that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You re-assure Asriel that you'll be there for him.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/15}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* ... I guess I just don't understand you, Frisk."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* No matter what I do to you... you just won't give in."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* Hey... maybe it won't be so bad."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/20}* Having you to support me definitely won't hurt either."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* ...\n* The thing is...\n* If I stayed here now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* It wouldn't be right by $(name), you know?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* And besides... with my SOUL back inside of me..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* I won't turn back into a star."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* So... there's no point in me staying here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/17}* Well.\n* Better get going."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/20}* Your friends are probably worried sick about you by now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* I don't know what's going to happen to $(name) after this."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* They held on for a chance to see me, but that's..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* ... in the past now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* I still can't believe they waited all that time just to see me..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/23}* Stubborn idiot."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* ... is what I would have said, if I was still a talking star."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* But... I don't really think they're an idiot."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* $(name)'s not stupid.\n* And I..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* I agreed with a lot of what they said about themselves..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* About them not being the kind of friend I wish I had..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* ... but it doesn't mean I wanted them gone!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* It's not like $(name) has to go away..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* If they wanted to, they could stay with us.\n* I'd like them to."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* But I'd understand if they wanted to go."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* They \"won\" their game.\n* They shouldn't want to \"play\" with me anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* ... $(name)...\n* If you're still there, listening..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* I want you to know that I love you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/23}* You might not have been the greatest person..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/22}* But, deep down, you still cared about me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/23}* Ha..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/22}* I probably seem like a crazy person right now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* Obsessing over someone I should have moved on from already..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/17}* ... I guess $(name) and I really are just a \n  pair of stubborn idiots."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* One time, $(name) and I were fighting over a bed..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* 'Cause, both of us wanted the one with the nightstand next to it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/15}* We were both pushing each other off the side, trying to make room..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* All that fighting got us so tired, that we fell asleep."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* But when we woke up..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* We were lying right next to each other."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* I tried to get up, but... they didn't want to let go."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/15}* They just kept saying..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* \"... warm...\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* \"... fluffy...\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/20}* I would have complained about it, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* ... at that point, I was just happy we weren't fighting."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* This other time, $(name) and I were making dinner for Mom and Dad."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* They kept wanting to make it more spicy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* To be honest, if they insisted on that now, I would not complain."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/20}* I could go for something spicy right about now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* But, back then, I was more into sweets.\n* Most monsters are."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* We ended up playing tug-of-war with the mixing bowl, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/20}* You can imagine how that turned out."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* Mom made us clean up the mess, of course."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* Then, Dad took us out to eat, and we both got what we wanted."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/15}* $(name) and I...\n* It's like we couldn't agree on anything..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/20}* Besides spending time together, that is."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/17}* Despite our differences, $(name) and I really were inseperable."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* Even death itself couldn't even keep us apart forever."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/17}* ... do you think they're still around, Frisk?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* For all you know, they could be watching us right now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/23}* Wouldn't that be something."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/22}* But it's impossible to know for sure."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/17}* Golly.\n* For someone who'll be staying with you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/20}* I sure am making it sound like I'd rather be with $(name)."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* But... it's not like that at all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* I just can't help but reminisce about someone I used to know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/17}* Frisk...\n* I want you to know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* Thanks to you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/23}* I feel like I have a future again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/22}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/22}* Even though you couldn't forgive me for what I'd done..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/22}* Even though I wanted you to do all those terrible things..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/22}* Even though I tortured you, and threatened everyone you love..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* You're still willing to help me move past it all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/23}* ... it means a lot."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* Mom, Dad..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* Sans, Papyrus, Undyne, Alphys..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* Everyone I've killed in past realities..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* ... it's going to difficult for me to face them."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* But I'll try."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/23}* I'll try to be a better person."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/22}* And, If I ever screw up..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* ... I know you'll be there to help me pick up the pieces."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* Ha... $(name)."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/23}* I won't let you down, okay?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/22}* I'll make the most out of this chance you've given me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* I'll make it count."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You saw a piece of gum taped to the comic strip...)"

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/10}* Something you missed back here?"

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* Ah, the place where it all began."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/4}* We've certainly come along since then, haven't we, $(name)?"

msgid "<32>* I think I'm actually going to miss this place."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It might've been our prison, but we really made it our own..."

msgid "<32>* I saw that goat lady take the taxi to the supermarket earlier."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* She said she was going off to buy milk, but she still hasn't come back..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I hope she's alright."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Sometimes, when I'm alone, I like to ride the taxi to the marketplace."

msgid "<32>* It's a quaint little shop, but there's loads of stuff to buy."

msgid "<32>* Maybe I'll take you there sometime... you'd adore it!"

msgid "<32>* Just be glad I'm off-duty...\n* 'Cause otherwise..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'd have your head."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/1}* Ready?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* 'Cause once we move forward, there's no turning back."
msgstr ""

msgid "* (Follow Him?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/2}* Okay..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Let's do this."

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/4}* I'll be waiting, then."

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* So, here is the riddle..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* \"What's baked like a cake and rhymes with a lie?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You tell Toriel the answer.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/7}* ... Pie?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* That's correct!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I must say, I did not expect you to solve it so easily..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* But I am all the more grateful for it!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (Despite your best efforts, you struggle to understand.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You tell Toriel you do not know the answer.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* If you cannot solve the riddle, that is alright."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I do not want to pressure you, after all..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Especially if it is something you are not quite ready for."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I suppose I can solve this one for you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I suppose I can solve this one for you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Ah... that is alright."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I do not want to pressure you, after all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* And... {#x1}there.\n* The way is clear."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* And... {#x1}there!\n* The way is clear."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Once ready, you may enter the next room..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Once ready, you may enter the next room."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* I never did figure out why this terminal was so tall..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Even now, the terminal still stands as tall as ever."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You got the Little Dipper.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "* (Equip the Little Dipper?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* Ah...!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Pies are for eating, not dropping on the ground."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Please do not spill food on the floor."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* Hey!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* How could you do that to those poor fried snails..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#n1}* Aww c'mon! ;)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I poured my heart into that! ;)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#n1}* Seriously!? ;)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That steak was utterly priceless! ;)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* In this room, I have a special training exercise."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* As a human who has just arrived here, monsters may attack you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* In this situation, you will enter a FIGHT."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Do not worry, the process in any such encounter is simple..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Strike up a friendly conversation to stall for time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* I will come to resolve the conflict."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* For now, practice talking to the dummy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Do you need any conversation topics?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Hmm..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Oh, I know!\n* Why not talk about how you got here?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I am sure you must have quite the story."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* There is nothing to be afraid of."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* A simple dummy cannot hurt you, can it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Now go on, give it a try..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Go on, give it a try..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* My child, the dummy is not for fighting!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* We don't want to hurt anyone, do we?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Come now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Ah, very good!\n* You are very good."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oh, you... you ran away..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* In truth, that was not a bad choice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Staying out of trouble is... preferable, to fighting anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* However, that was only a dummy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It has no desire for revenge..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Never mind.\n* Stay close to me, and I will protect you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The next room awaits."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* The next room awaits!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/7}* Oh my..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* You are adorable, my child!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* In any case, we shall continue forward."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* The next room awaits!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* My goodness, child!\n* Have mercy!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Fortunately, that was only a dummy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* But in the future, please..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Try not to slap your opponents half to death, will you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Come now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}{#n1}* Tasty, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}{#n1}* I hope your breakfast sufficed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Aaron pulled out his phone and snapped a picture."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#n1}* Ooh, I could definitely put this on an poster somewhere ;)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Aaron shot you with a wink."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#n1}* You like the product, lassy? ;)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Who does he think he is?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You've been nothing but kind to everyone we've met."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That talking star really needs to get a life..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/12}* You idiot..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Didn't you hear me before!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* I thought I told you not to screw it up!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Now look what you've done to our plan."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* You better fix this, $(name)."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* It's our destiny."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}* Howdy, $(name)."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* I've had some time to think about what happened."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* It was thrilling, at first..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* The thought of taking the outpost by force together..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* But now, I'm not sure."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* I guess... I got a bit carried away back there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* But that's okay, right?\n* You'll forgive me, won't you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* I'm still not really sure what happened back there..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* It's... kinda scaring me, haha..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* Maybe... we should hold off on things for now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* But that's okay, right?\n* You'll be fine with that, won't you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* Goodbye, $(name)..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I'll be back before you know it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/5}* Howdy!\n* I'm {@fill:#ff0}TWINKLY{@fill:#fff}.\n* {@fill:#ff0}TWINKLY{@fill:#fff} the {@fill:#ff0}STAR{@fill:#fff}!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/event}* Apologies.\n* This was not the intended course of events."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The data at your last SAVE point indicates Asriel has absorbed Toriel's SOUL."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* However, Asriel's character data indicates he no longer intends to repeat this event."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Therefore, it is possible for you to LOAD to a point at which these states conflict."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* This possibility creates an anomaly in the causal nexus which cannot be accounted for."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* To put it in simpler terms, Asriel would be forced to react to each LOAD you perform."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* As he can remember each LOAD, his reaction would vary from one instance to the next."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* As you can LOAD an infinite number of times, he would have an infinite set of reactions."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* An infinite set of reactions cannot exist, and as such, this scenario cannot continue."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/event}* Goodbye."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Sorry, did I miss something?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I've never talked to him in my life, let alone go on some mission with him."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Oh well.\n* It wouldn't be the first time he's made up stories about me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/5}{#v/0}* Well, that was unexpected."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* You sure have a knack for breaking the rules, don'tcha?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Hee hee hee..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/1}* In this world, it's KILL or BE killed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/5}{#v/0}* Clever.\n* Verrrryy clever."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* You think you're really smart, don'tcha?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* If you had just killed a FEW more monsters..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}{#v/0}* Well, maybe I shouldn't reveal my plans this early."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* You know, $(name)..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* It's only a matter of time before we're together again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* Try a little harder next time, and maybe..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* You'll get to see something new."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Until we meet again..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* If you had just killed ONE more monster..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* So you made it through without killing anyone."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* So you spared the life of everyone you came across."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* I bet you feel really great."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}{#v/1}* But what will you do if you meet a serial murderer?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}{#v/0}* You'll die, and you'll die, and you'll die..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* Eventually, you'll tire of trying."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* What then, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}{#v/1}* Will you KILL out of frustration?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/14}{#v/1}* Or will you simply GIVE UP?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Hee hee hee..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* This is gonna be SO much fun."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}{#v/0}* I'll be watching!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* So you managed to stay out of one person's way."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* So you spared the life of a single person."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* But what about everyone else, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Froggit, Flutterlyte, Gelatini, Silente, Oculoux, Mushy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* Don'tcha think any of them have families?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* Don'tcha think any of them have friends?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* Each one could've been someone else's Toriel."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Selfish brat."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/1}* Someone's dead because of you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/1}* Monsters are dead because of you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/5}{#v/0}* I'm sure you're well aware of that, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* Considering you've already killed Toriel once before."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Ain't that right, brat?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}{#v/1}* You MURDERED her."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* And then, you felt bad...\n* Ain't that right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Do you think you're the only one with that power?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* The power to reshape the universe, purely by your own will..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* The power to SAVE..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* That used to be MY power, you know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* Seems YOUR desires for this world override MINE."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* Well then.\n* Enjoy that power while you can."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/0}* They're all gone now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* What's Toriel gonna do when she finds out, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}{#v/1}* What if she KILLS herself out of grief?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* If you think you're saving her just by SPARING her..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Then you're even dumber than I thought."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Well, see ya!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* After all, this used to be MY power."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* I thought I was the only one who could do that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/11}{#v/0}* You're one hell of a tease, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* Beating monsters within an inch of their lives, only to let them go..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* What will you do if a monster doesn't WANT your mercy?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* Will you snuff the light out of their eyes?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* Or will you realize your faulty \"pacifism\" is for nothing?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/7}{#v/0}* Wow, you're utterly repulsive."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/11}{#v/0}* You got by peacefully..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* Then, you figured that wasn't good enough for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}{#v/1}* So you KILLED her just to see what would happen."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/0}* You did it out of BOREDOM."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Don't think I don't know how this works..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* It's sad, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/11}{#v/0}* Look at you, playing with her life like this..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Killing her, leaving her, killing her again..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Leaving her, killing her, leaving her again..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* It's fun, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* Endlessly toying with the lives of others..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* Watching how they react to every possible decision..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Isn't it thrilling?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}{#v/0}* I wonder what you'll do next."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* I'll be watching..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/10}{#v/0}* You just can't get enough, can you~"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* How many more times will you KILL her, eh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/1}* You kinda remind me of myself."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}{#v/0}* Well, cya!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* Again?\n* Golly..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/1}* You REALLY remind me of myself."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* Again!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* Wow, you're even worse than I thought."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/5}{#v/0}* So you've finally gotten by peacefully, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/5}{#v/0}* So you've finally decided to show mercy, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* And after all that KILLING..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Say, was this your idea all along?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}{#v/1}* To get a rush out of her death, then spare her once you got bored?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* What a saint you must think you are."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* But hey, it's not as if I don't know how this works..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/11}{#v/0}* Hee hee hee..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* I hope you like your choice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}{#v/0}* I mean, it's not as if you can go back and change fate."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* That old woman thought she could break the rules."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* She tried so hard to save you humans..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* But when it came down to it, she couldn't even save herself."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* So you finally caved in and killed someone, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Well, I hope you like your choice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* ... what's wrong?\n* Did she not last as long as you thought?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/6}{#v/0}* Oh, how terrible.\n* Guess not everyone can be beat into submission."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* What an idiot!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* What a shame for her."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* As for you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* Wow."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* And here I thought you were the righteous one for showing mercy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Hah!\n* What a joke."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* How did it feel to finally satisfy your violent side?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/1}* I bet it felt GOOD, didn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* I mean, I should know..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/5}{#v/0}* Nice to see you again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* By the way, you're the most boring person in the galaxy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}{#v/0}* Getting by peacefully, then going back just to do it again?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* Come on..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}{#v/1}* You know as well as I do that it's KILL or BE killed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}* Aren't you getting tired of this?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}{#v/1}* You KNOW deep down that part of you wants to hurt her."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/14}{#v/1}* One. Little. Touch.\n* She'd be dead before your very eyes."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Wouldn't that be exciting?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* See ya, idiot."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/8}{#v/0}* Are you doing this just to see how I react?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* Is that what this is about?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Well, don't expect to get anything else outta me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* All this boring pacifism is getting tiresome."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Now, if something more interesting were to happen..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}{#v/0}* Perhaps I'd be more inclined to talk."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Sooner or later, you'll be forced to realize that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* And when that time comes..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* Well, let's just say I'm interested to see what happens."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}{#v/0}* Good luck!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Maybe that's why you killed that one monster."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* I mean, you went almost the whole way without killing anyone..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* But somewhere along the line, you screwed up."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* All that good karma you had went straight down the toilet."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Golly, you can't do anything right!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* What a joke!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Maybe that's why you killed those other monsters."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* I mean, you had a good run, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* What's the point in mercy if it doesn't mean anything?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* And believe me, after you did what you did..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}{#v/1}* It doesn't mean JACK."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* What's wrong with killing Toriel, huh?\n* Too good for that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}{#v/1}* I know you're still rotten to the core."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* I mean, you managed to take out everyone in your path..."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* Back again, huh?\n* Golly..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* You've changed the timeline around so much..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* I don't even know what to think now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* Are you good?\n* Evil?\n* Just curious?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* I dunno."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* There is one thing, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* One thing I KNOW you haven't done yet."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* That's right."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* You haven't killed everyone here in one run yet."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Aren't you at least a LITTLE curious?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* Come on, $(name)..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* I know you're in there somewhere."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* Well well, we meet again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* How many times is this now?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* Whatever.\n* Doesn't matter."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* You KNOW what you have to do, $(name)."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* I'll be waiting."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* You wish to return \"home,\" do you not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* If you leave here, I will not be able to protect you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* I will not be able to save you from the dangers that lie ahead."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* So, please, little one..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Go back the other way."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* Every human that ends up here meets the same fate."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* I have seen it repeated time and time again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* They come."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* They leave."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* ... they die."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* My child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* If you leave the Outlands..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* They...\n* ASGORE...\n* Will take your SOUL."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* I did not want to say this, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}* I cannot allow you to continue on this path."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* For your own sake, child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Do not follow me into the next room."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/14}* Ha...\n* Haha..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* Perhaps it was always meant to come to this."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Perhaps I was foolish to think that you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* Well, you leave me with little choice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* I am sorry, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}* But I cannot allow you to leave."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/twinkly}{#f/19}* After you run back to Mommy's house, she goes out for groceries."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#x1}* But... oh no!\n* The taxi she was in exploded, killing her instantly!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Golly, I wonder how such an awful thing could have happened."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#x2}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* Sorry, $(name).\n* Guess your happy ending won't be so easy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#x1}* But... oh no!\n* A talking star appears and tortures her to death!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Golly, that's an even worse outcome than last time!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* We've don't have time for this, $(name).\n* Get back on track."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/5}* Come on, $(name)..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* Do you really think I'm gonna let you run away from me THAT easily?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}* We can do this all day."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/8}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* After you return to Toriel's home, she destroys the bridge to the outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Time goes by, and Toriel soon finds out about the monsters you've killed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Her hopes shattered, and with nothing left to lose, she..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... meanwhile, the remaining residents of the outpost are suffering..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Time goes by, and Toriel does her best to care for you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... despite those who've gone missing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Meanwhile, the residents of the outpost are suffering..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Time goes by, and Toriel does her best to care for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Reading books, baking pies, telling stories...\n* And plenty of hugs, of course."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Still trapped within the force field, with no means of escape."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Is this really the outcome you had hoped for?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Is this what they really deserve?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Sorry for the wait..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* It seems that little white dog has raided my kitchen again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* You should see the state of that pie..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/0}* But anyhoo.\n* I have prepared a plate of fried snails for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Voila, breakfast is ready!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>* I have prepared a plate of fried snails for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I will leave them here on the table..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/3}* Oh, you might like what's in the fridge."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* You wouldn't like what's in the fridge."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* There is a brand-name chocolate bar in the fridge."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Do you want it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "* (Take the Chocolate Bar?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You decide not to take anything.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You got the Chocolate Bar.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/21}* Too bad there was only one in there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* The chocolate bar has already been taken."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* ... and you want to play one of your songs?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Alright, I will see what I can do."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* Up already!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* You weren't asleep for very long..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "toriel"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* The atmospheric system still does not seem to be fixed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* The atmospheric system seems to be malfunctioning."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* If you begin to feel weak, do not hesitate to return to bed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/0}* ... anywho."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* How long have you been standing there!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I suppose it matters not."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Napstablook, a visitor here, has offered to play their music."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* In fact, they invited you specifically to be with them on stage!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Would you like to visit the activities room to see them?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Oh, and, I apologize about the state of the pie."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* It seems that little white dog has raided my kitchen again..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Oh, and, I apologize about the state of the pie."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* I did my best to try and salvage it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "* (See Napstablook's show?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Wonderful!\n* I will let them know you are coming."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* I will be in the living room if you need me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Oh, hello, little one.\n* You are up early."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Are you sure you slept for a long enough time?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/0}* ... aside from that..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Good morning, little one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Still, I have done my best to salvage it for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It is a rather nice day today, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I will be in the living room if you need me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* The OUTLANDS have been unusually noisy today."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* It seems a bully has been going around and causing trouble..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* It would be best not to stray too far."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* The OUTLANDS have been unusually silent today."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* No fussing, no bussing..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Nothing, save for that little yellow star..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Er, nevermind."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* In other news, that little white dog has raided my kitchen again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Apart from the little white dog raiding my kitchen, that is."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I hope you like it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It is rather worrying..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Anyhoo, I will be in the living room if you need me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/10}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/20}{|}* Come here- {%}"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/19}{|}* Come here- {%}"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* I am sorry for what I have put you through."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* I know I cannot keep you here against your will."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* However... if you ever need someone to talk to out there..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Feel free to call me, at any time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* And if you need to return here for any reason..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I will do my best to accomedate you during your stay."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* I will miss you, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/14}* Be good, alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Be good, alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* You changed your mind..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* Perhaps you really are different from them..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* ... well then."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I will finish up here, and meet you back at the house."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Thank you for listening, my child."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It means a lot to me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Forgive me, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* I... think I lost it there for a moment..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You got the Halo.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "* (Equip the Halo?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Teaching you thus far has been difficult, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Perhaps this exercise will help."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* So far, we have learned how to solve puzzles and handle encounters."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Now, there is a far more important lesson you must learn."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Tell me, do you think you can make it to the end of this room..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* ... without my help?"
msgstr ""

msgid "* (What do you say?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Are you sure?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* It is only a short distance away..."
msgstr ""

msgid "* (Change your mind?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Err..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It IS important to do things on your own, correct?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Alright..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Good luck!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/10}* Worry not, my child."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* If you truly do not wish to leave my side, then..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I will guide you through the remainder of the OUTLANDS."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Take my hand, young one..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* We're going home."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}{#s/equip}* (You got the CELL.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* You made it!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* My child, what took you so long??"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* Are you alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Hmm...\n* You do seem to be fine..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, regardless, it is good to see you again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/1}* I must admit, I am surprised at how you handled yourself here..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Your behavior in earlier tests left much to be desired."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/23}* ... have you been trying to mess with me the whole time?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Well, regardless, I have some important errands to run."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Do not worry, you were never in any danger..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* This was merely a test of your independence!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* As it happens, I have some important errands to run."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* While I am away, I expect you to be on your best behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* There are puzzles ahead which I have yet to explain, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Leaving the room on your own may prove to be dangerous."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* Here.\n* Take this CELL phone."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* If you need anything while I am away, please..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Do not hesitate to call."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/23}* Stay out of trouble, alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Be good, alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#s/phone}{#p/event}* Ring, ring..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Hello!\n* This is TORIEL."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* My errands are taking longer than I thought they would."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* You must wait a little longer."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Thank you for being patient, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* You are a very good child."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Hello...\n* This is TORIEL."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I found what I was looking for..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* But a small, white puppy snatched it away!\n* How odd."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Do dogs even like flour?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Err, that is an unrelated question, of course."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* It will take a little longer for me to return."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Thank you again for being so patient..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* (...)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You hear heavy panting on the other end of the phone.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#s/bark}{#p/event}* Bark!\n* Bark!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You hear a distant voice.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* Stop, please!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Come back here with my cell phone!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (It sounds like a small, white dog is sleeping on the phone.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* (Snore... snore...)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Hellooo?\n* Little puppy...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Where are youuu?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I will give you a nice pat on the head!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (The snoring stops.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* ... if you return with my cell phone."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (The snoring resumes.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* (Achoo!)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (It sounds like a small, white dog sneezing in its sleep.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* (You hear a distant voice.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Aha!\n* I heard that, you little white dog..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* Now I am going to find you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (The snoring stops.)\n* (The dog now seems to be on the run from something.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/8}* Hee hee, there is no escape!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Hello...\n* This is... Toriel..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* No, bad puppy!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* (Whimper... whimper...)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* There, there...\n* I will find another cell phone for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Would that be alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#s/bark}{#p/event}* Bark!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Glad to hear it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (The dog could be heard walking away.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Please, forgive me for all of this nonsense."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I will be back to pick you up shortly..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Hello?\n* This is TORIEL."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#g/torielTired}* ... already?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* I really should not be surprised."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Just remember the dangers that lie ahead of you out there..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It would be a shame if you got hurt."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* You have not left the room, have you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* There are many dangers out there, and I do not want you to get hurt."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Take care of yourself, alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* A few minutes later..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* I have returned!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Your patience thus far has been commendable.\n* Even I am impressed!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Anyhoo.\n* It is time I took you home now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Please, allow me!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Welcome to our humble outpost, innocent one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* This place may seem strange to you now, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* With time, and a little guidance, you will grow accustomed to it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Allow me to educate you in the operation of the OUTLANDS."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* This place is full of old puzzles."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* One must unlock them to move from room to room..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Please, adjust yourself to the sight of them."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* When you are ready, we may proceed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#n1}* I heard you're quite flirty, for a human."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That's it, I just wanted to mention that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* What?\n* Were you expecting some kind of advice?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Get outta here...\n* There is no good advice when it comes to flirting."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Only awkwardness."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Lots and lots of awkwardness."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#n1}* Hey human, have you tried flirting yet?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Ha!\n* I can tell by the look on your face that you haven't yet."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I gotta tell you, it's tons of fun."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Your enemies won't know what to do with themselves!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#n1}* Hey human, now that you've started flirting..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* How does it feel?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's pretty great, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Yeah.\n* Keep it up!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#n1}* I hear you're somewhat of a bully around here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Hah!\n* Join the club, pal."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You're talking to the number one bully around."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#n1}* I heard you're quite the hero around here now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Everyone likes you, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Well... personally, I think you have too much free time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#n1}* What?\n* Am I wrong?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#n1}* So, you're the one who co-hosted that music show, eh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Maybe now you'll have the means to accept my offer."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'm just lookin' for someone to buy this limited edition Super Starwalker comic strip."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Now I liked that little show, so you'll get a discount.\n* 5G, take it or leave it."
msgstr ""

msgid "{#n1!}* (Buy the comic strip?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#n1}* Hey, have you noticed anything strange goin' on around here?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I could'a sworn all the puzzles just de-activated themselves earlier."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Anyway, I'm lookin' for a buyer on this limited edition Super Starwalker comic strip."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#n1}* Finally, someone speaks to me!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I've been standin' out here for ages, and nobody's takin' my offer."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Interested?\n* All I'm askin' for is 10G."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#n1}* Interested in buyin' my limited edition Super Starwalker comic strip?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* All I'm askin' for is 5G."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* All I'm askin' for is 10G."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}{#n1!}* (You don't have enough G.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#n1}* I'll be honest, that don't look like 5G..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#n1}* I'll be honest, that don't look like 10G..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#n1}* Not interested, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I often wonder if they are different from the one in the Outlands"

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* I often wonder if I will ever go there again."

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Their company is always nice, even if they do not see it that way."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I have tried comforting them on several occasions..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Nothing seems to cheer them up for long."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I suspect someone else is to blame for their wallows..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Although, lately they have seemed happier..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I do hope their good moods continue."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The Outlands bridge, hmm?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* And to think I was about to..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, there is nothing to worry about now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Carry on, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* ...\n* I apologize for that, my child."

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* That vending machine has broken down more times than I can count."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I fear much of the technology around here is out of date..."

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, I call it it a yard."

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Then, we realized there would be no use for the extra space."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Interesting, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The very edge of the outpost..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Are you feeling nostalgic, my child?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Or perhaps you are looking for something..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, in any case, please do not stay out for too long."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* You would not want to forget the way back!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oho, I know where you are..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The ambient noise of that room is unmistakable."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* Not to mention, that terminal was much too tall for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Well, most of the terminals in the Outlands are short..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* How odd.\n* That particular one happened to be different."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I must say, I am not proud of how I dealt with that Froggit..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* That could have been a great learning exercise!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I suppose there is no sense in worrying about it now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The past cannot be changed, after all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The dummy room...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Hee hee, I am still proud of the way you handled that test."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Talking it out is preferable to violence..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Even when it seems unrealistic."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Although you did not handle that test well..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I am sure you learned from it going forward."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* That was the idea, was it not...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Oh, how could I forget the way you ran..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Perhaps you were not ready for a battle at the time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Although, considering what happened between us..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I highly doubt it is an issue for you now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Truthfully, I still do not know how to react to what happened."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It was mesmerising to watch, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Just... the two of you... staring at each other..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Ah, how could I forget how adorable you were..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I have taught many... erm, monsters, how to handle encounters."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* None of them ever did it quite like you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I would even go as far as to say you had the better idea!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* The next time you come across a dummy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Slapping them might not be a great idea."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* Or it is a great idea, and I am simply the crazy one here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Who knows!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* Hahahahaha!\n* Ah- I could not hold in the laughter!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Never in my life did I expect you to FLIRT..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Let alone like the way you did!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Listen to me, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Flirting with your adversaries is almost never ideal."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* But YOU..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* You seem to have a knack for it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Maybe you could use that to your advantage somehow."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* That is where I introduced myself to you, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Who would have thought you would come all this way."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I suppose there is not much else to say."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Are you leaving the Outlands, my child?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I want you to remember something."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Whatever happens out there, no matter how bad it is..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I want you to know that I have faith in you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I know you want to continue to do the right thing, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I know you can."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* So, remember that for me, alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I love you, little one..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Good luck."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Ah, the room I did not want you to enter."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* And for good reason..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It is where you tend to run into the more, erm, \"active\" monsters."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Ones that believe it is their duty to defend the outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* While they have every right to do so..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* That does not mean I have to agree with it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* This area is but a few steps away from the taxi stop."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Although it is a mostly uninteresting room..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* There were plans to make it into a community area of sorts."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Outlands visitors would be met with a warm, welcoming atmosphere."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Over time, though, our plans for the area changed..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Now, all you can find there are defunct pieces of equipment."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I do wonder..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Did they ever fix the power lines in that room?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, perhaps I should go take a look at that sometime."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Are those monsters STILL sitting there?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* They never seem to be anywhere else..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Truly, it is an odd way to live."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* How does one eat?\n* How does one drink?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* We may never know the answers to these questions, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* The activities room.\n* We host all kinds of performances there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Drama, dance nights, and the arts, of course..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It is always good to see people expressing themselves."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I once attended a comedy in that very room."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It was the hardest I have ever laughed in my life!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* That area is almost never visited by anyone..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Truthfully, there is a good reason for that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It is the same reason there is a locked door nearby."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Perhaps it would be best if we did not discuss it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Ah, that must be your room!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I really do hope you like it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Your... room..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Perhaps it is no longer as such."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Still, I am glad that you could get some rest."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Did you know that my home used to have a basement?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* In fact, it led right to the exit of the Outlands."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* However, there were issues with the gravity in that section, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Well, we do not want monsters floating away, do we?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* My, that would be terrible!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* There is not much to say about the hallway..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/0}* Though, you can take a look in the mirror, if you like."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I hear self-reflection can be quite useful."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Do you know why there is so much fur in my sink?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* You see, lately, I had to shed quite a bit of mine."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* You can imagine where all of that ended up."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* What? This is perfectly normal for boss monsters."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* There is no need to call me when I am right here, little one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Rummaging around in the living room, are we?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Say.\n* Have you read all of the books yet?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* There is so much interesting material!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Oh, that is my favorite puzzle room!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* ... that sounded better in my head."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/1}* But there is something nice about how it teaches collaboration..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Oh, I sound like a veritable scholar!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Well, actually, my dream job is to become a caregiver."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* There is just something rewarding about helping children grow."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* That is where I found you, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* To think you could have been killed by that awful thing..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* He has been a pest here for some time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I wonder where he came from..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* All alone out there, by yourself..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It is a good thing I was there to bring you in."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Who knows what awful things could have happened otherwise..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Although it is just a simple taxi stop..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I often see monsters walk out there to take their mind off things."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I suppose, here in the Outlands..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* We really can make anything multi-purpose."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* There is a reason why that room is so long and windy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The idea was that it would slow down invading human forces."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Can you imagine how difficult it would be..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* For an army of foot soldiers to traverse that path?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, that was the intention, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It seems that, in truth, we had nothing to worry about."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Calling this early...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* You should really get going, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I promise everything will be okay."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Be good, will you not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Have you met Sans?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I sure hope he and his brother are taking good care of you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Nothing less for such a sweet child!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oh, Sans..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* You must have several hilarious stories to tell about him."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* He may be an OLD SOUL..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* But he's got a real PENSION for humor!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* An old landing pad?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* From your description, it sounds like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Like the pad I helped set up for the early Starton engineers!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* At the time, Starton was our biggest project to date."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Workers complained about long commutes to the build site..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* So we threw in a spacecraft landing pad for quick access!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Progress on Starton sped up quite a ways, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* ... um, am I rambling again?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Sans has told me all about his brother's fondness for puzzles."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I hear he has even created some of his own...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It sounds exciting."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I would love to try one sometime!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Alas, I must oversee these Outlands..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Please, can somebody explain \"dog justice?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* It is an odd phrase I continue to hear every so often."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I do know of one little puppy that likes to visit the Outlands..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Maybe they are the one who deserves justice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Hmm..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* I wonder what kind of food is sold in Starton these days."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Cakes?\n* Pies?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well.\n* I sure hope it is nice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/15}* It better not be rationed ice cream."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Sans's fondness for spot-the-difference puzzles..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Has always been confusing to me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Knowing him, I get the strangest feeling..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* That there is more to it than meets the eye."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Or, eye-socket in his case, I suppose.\n* Hee hee."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Why would someone want to solve a near- impossible puzzle?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Sans never stops talking about his brother's spaghetti."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* But just imagine the PASTABILITIES..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Rigatoni!\n* Fettuccine!\n* Acini Di Pepe!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Some variety could really help him go FARFALLE."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Go BIGOLI or go home, as they say!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Math is certainly not my favorite subject..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* ... but it does make for a good puzzle!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Umm... most of the time, it does."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* But umm..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Who has time for that, anyway?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* To my knowledge, Dr. Alphys is the current royal scientist."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Although she may never replace the experience of Dr. Roman..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I am sure she is more than capable of finding her own path forward."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* This may surprise you, but I have a certain respect for scientists."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Such analytical minds!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* If I were you, I would steer clear of dubious salesfolk."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* You never know what strings they may pull..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* A lesson I have had to learn the hard way, unfortunately."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* It is fortunate most of Starton is outdoors."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Otherwise, I would not be able to take your calls!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* My, I should think about getting an upgrade."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* With quality this wooden, it is a wonder we can call at all..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* You must have crossed into town by now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* What do you think?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Napstablook often tells of how friendly it is..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I am glad that such an environment could be fostered out there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Sans says his house is on the south side of town."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Last I checked, there were no \"sides\" to town..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The town I remember was one large square."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Perhaps there was a split at some point?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oh, hello...!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* So you found a spot with good reception, it seems...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* A good can be rather hard to come by out there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* Though, my old device might have something to do with that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It is good to hear from you, though."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Please, keep yourself safe out there, will you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* I have heard the guards there are... ruthless."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Especially the dogs."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Ah, there you are."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I hope that royal guard captain is not giving you trouble."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* A visitor here once said she's obsessed with spears..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Funny.\n* The captain I recall was into sabers."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I wonder if you know who the \"Saber of Justice\" is..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oh no..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Synthbushes!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Those things are horrible to get stuck in."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* They get you all itchy and scratchy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* But I know you are smart enough to avoid the danger."
msgstr ""

msgid "f_bird"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Things sound oughly silent where you are..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* As if there is something missing..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Something important..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, no matter.\n* My imagination can run wild sometimes..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Nothing like the chirp of a fearsome little bird..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* That bird has always been there for us."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Taking us places..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* I once used its services to carry grocies!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* ... back when we all lived in that cramped factory."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Chirp, chirp, chirp..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Being trapped there is not a memory I like to revisit."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* For all the dark and dingy places in that factory..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* There are pockets of beauty to be found."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Carpe diem, little one.\n* Do not pass up the chance to see them..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I take it you have been in Aerialis for a while now?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Hee hee.\n* Exploration is not such a bad thing!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Just be sure not to turn purple like the rest of the place."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/4}* It is a very serious condition, my child."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* The royal lab is such a great place to learn."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Being the home of so many breakthroughs, it is quite storied."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* If I ever become a teacher, I would host a field trip here!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* With Dr. Alphys's permission of course."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I wonder if Aerialis is still full of scaffolding..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* They should have finished the project by now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Somehow, I am not filled with confidence."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oh, I had almost forgotten about Sans."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* He is still looking after you, is he not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* That, or he has once again started selling corn dogs."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Why do I get the feeling it is the latter."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Silly skeleton."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* When hearing about your hijinks with Mettaton..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I had a thought."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* How could a robot like him exist after our ban on AI programs?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Surely Dr. Alphys would not break such a well- established rule..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* There must be some other explanation."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* A fountain?\n* I do not remember any fountains out there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Then again, I have been away for a long time..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I am sure I would be very surprised if I came out there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I wonder what other wild things they have built!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Spire houses, perhaps?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Be wary of abandoned side pathways in Aerialis."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* You may find secrets you wish you had not stumbled upon..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* If you enter the rec center, I will not be able to reach you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Past the rec center is the CORE... and the CITADEL."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* This could very well be the last time I hear from you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* Please, young one... be good, won't you?"
msgstr ""

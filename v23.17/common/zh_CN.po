msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/5}* Managed to convince her not to make an announcement "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/10}* There was some tension between them at first, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/6}* ... things feel like they're kind of back to normal, "

msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/2}* O-oh, uh, that's not what I meant!"

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/6}* Yeah... you do."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* you should probably go give the humans their daily "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* i can take over on the phone while you're gone."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/alphys}{#f/6}* Sounds good.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* so here we are, then."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* now, since you left, i've been asking myself..."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* \"why would they go out of their way solely to kill "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* and i'm not talking about asgore."

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* i think we both know the reason."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* i think we both know it wasn't out of self- defense."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* come on.\n"
"* let's be honest with ourselves here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* you just did it to see what'd happen."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* well, congratulations!\n"

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* hey.\n"

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* ... i just wish i could say the same about my brother."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* hmm...\n"
"* what else should i mention?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* ... right.\n"
"* new living arrangements."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* so, after the former queen returned..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* she and i recognized eachother and got to talking."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* one thing led to another, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* she agreed to move in with me to my house in starton "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* ... sure.\n"
"* there's a lot we were excited about."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* the books i gave her, the recipes she tried to teach "
"me..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* but... y'know..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* none of that stuff ever made up for what happened to "
"papyrus."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* she still feels pretty bad about that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* not just because she cares about me, but also..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* because she cared about you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* you can imagine how she felt when she realized what "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* spoiler alert.\n"
"* not good."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* ... and the public at large doesn't seem to feel much "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* at least in terms of your reputation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* still.\n"
"* could be worse."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* at the very least, alphys and i are confident..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* in our ability to escort the next human to safety."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* so that's something."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* welp.\n"
"* looks like i'll have to cut this short."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* just... think about what i've said, ok?"

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/9}TURNS OUT I'M PRETTY DARN GOOD AT IT, TOO!"

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/2}HER WORDS -AND- MINE."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/5}* Sounds like fun.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}SURE, I'LL LET YOU VISIT."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}AFTER YOU AGREE TO TELL UNDYNE OUR SECRET."

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* sorry i'm late, by the way."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* the people on the floor above us want me to make "

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/32}* ..."

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}WELL, AS A MEMBER OF THE ROYAL GUARD..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}MY OPINION -SHOULD- CARRY SOME REAL WEIGHT!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* hmm... normally i'd say no to something like this, "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* undyne does seem to have a certain respect for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* besides, i've been thinking about it too."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/22}* W-well, don't go saying anything unless I give the "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* wouldn't dream of it."

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}UNLESS THAT ALSO COUNTS AS DREAMING."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* well, i should probably get started on that dinner now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/5}* To be honest..."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/5}* It would be nice to not have to hide all of this "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/6}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/8}* I-I'll think about it after I hang up the phone."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* I feel that you should know what has happened since "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* After you ran away from me, I reconsidered my own "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* I felt... guilty.\n"
"* For trying to keep you in the Outlands."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* For trying to keep ALL the humans there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* I decided I could stay there no longer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* I worked up the courage to leave, and returned to "
"the Citadel."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/18}* ... when I saw that the humans were trapped in those"
" boxes..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* I released them without a second thought."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/toriel}{#f/10}* I did not want them to be trapped any more than I "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* ... but this decision was not without its "
"consequences."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* Not only were the humans traumatized by ASGORE's "
"archive..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* But one of them ran off, and was discovered by the "
"public."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/18}* I did not want to keep them here against their will,"
" but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* The death of the royal guard's captain, and loss of "
"the king..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* ... placed humanity's reputation in a rather "
"difficult position."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* With the public knowing the truth about the "
"humans..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* I had no choice but to do whatever I could to "
"safeguard them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/15}* Uh, not to interrupt, but... you have a visitor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/10}* Let me guess.\n"
"* Sans?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/3}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* There is no need to be so formal when he is the one "
"at the gate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* System, unlock the gate, authorization Toriel "
"PIE-1-1-0."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* ...\n"
"* it's about time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* you still on the phone with the human?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/23}* On the WHAT!?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Yes, I thought it would be nice if they heard from "
"you, Sans."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Perhaps Alphys would like to join us as well?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/21}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/21}* No.\n"
"* Alphys would not."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/21}* In fact, Alphys would like to leave now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/24}* ... I'll be outside if you need me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* she's... still pretty upset about what happened to "
"undyne."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* about what she's had to do as a result."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* she's... still pretty angry about what you did to "
"undyne."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* and you know what?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* i really get it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* i know what alphys must be going through right now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* after all..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* she's not the only one who lost someone."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* and while i wouldn't blame you for running away..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* and while i wouldn't blame you for trying to defend "
"yourself..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* i can't help but wonder if there was a better way to go"
" about things."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* if, maybe somehow, this all could have been avoided."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* but i digress."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* there's too much at stake in the present to worry about"
" the past."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* it's been difficult without the royal guard to protect "
"us."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* not that i was a big fan of those guys before, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* at a time like this, it'd be nice to have them around."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* Yes, sadly, I am inclined to agree."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* It seems not a day goes by without an angered "
"citizen at the gate."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* But it cannot be helped."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* There are few who share my willingness to treat "
"humans as individuals."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}{#v/1}{@fill:#42fcff}* Toriel, are we in danger?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* ... oh, hello!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Do not worry, my child.\n"
"* I will always be here to protect you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}{#v/1}{@fill:#42fcff}* ... thank you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Now, please go back and wait with the others."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* I will be with you shortly."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}{#v/1}{@fill:#42fcff}* Okay, I'll go..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/10}* ... very good."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/10}* I suppose I cannot judge the citizens too harshly..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* ... knowing the sorts of choices you made during your"
" time here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* It was... difficult, even for me, to accept what you"
" had done."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* It is... an unfortunate situation we find ourselves "
"in."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* y'know..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* i wanted to go to grillby's the other day, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* their entire stock got raided last week."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* turns out grillby was a pro-human supporter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* I am... sorry to hear that, Sans.\n"
"* You liked going there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* yeah, being pro-human is basically a death sentence "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* at least where your business is concerned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/12}* ... this is not the only instance of this happening."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/11}* Many others have had the same fate."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* yeah, but you know what the worst part is?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* this isn't what monsters are supposed to be like."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* the homeworld was said to be peaceful, and even during "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* at least we were still united as a species."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* now, it just feels like... people can't get along."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* i could really use my brother's encouragement right "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* and that really stinks."

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/3}* Uh... guys?"

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/3}* I think you need to come see this."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#f/23}* You need to look outside."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* toriel, did you lock the gate after i got through?"

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* ..."

msgid ""
"<25>{|}{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* I... I am sorry!\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* at least we have the royal guard around to back us up."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* what's left of it, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/14}* It is fortunate we have their support."

"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* I ran to the Citadel as fast as I could to stop him "

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* I realized I had been wrong about him this whole "

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* ..."

"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* As well as something about a \"Mew Mew Space "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/4}* I still do not know what that means."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Anyhoo, to summarize... she wasn't ready to become "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* And she agreed to appoint me instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Only then, did I hear about the royal guard captain's"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* And the fact that, had you acted, you might have "

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* I only have my own cowardice to blame, however."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* If I had simply posessed the courage leave sooner..."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* I could have gone with you and pointed you in the "

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* And the fact that you were the one to have killed "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* As well as the death of Sans's brother, Papyrus."
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* I could have gone with you and encouraged a more "

msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* Alas, there was nothing more to be done."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* As queen, I did not have time to dwell on such "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* The humans' safety was at stake, and I would not lose"
" them again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/10}* My first act as queen would be to increase their "
"protection."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<26>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Admittedly, this would be difficult, given the lack "
"of a royal guard."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Admittedly, I was out of practice in handling these "
"sorts of matters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* But with the help of an old friend, Gerson, and his "
"contacts..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I was able to arrange a minimal security detail here "
"in the Citadel."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* It is not much, but the humans and their secret are "
"safer now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Since then, life has carried on as usual..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Despite the loss of the king, and royal guard as a "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Despite the loss of the king, and former royal guard "
"captain..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The people still have hope for their freedom."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Hope that... I will deliver it to them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* In a way, I understand what ASGORE must have been "
"going through now."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/10}* The weight of such outrageous demands being made of "
"me..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* ... it is changing who I am as a person."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Earlier today, in fact."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* When Sans came to reminisce about his brother, I..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* I declined out of a desire to be left alone."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* He shrugged, and walked off like nothing was wrong..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* But I knew he must have been disappointed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* When Papyrus came to reminisce about Undyne, I..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* He tried to act like nothing was wrong..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* But I knew he was probably upset."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* ... I felt guilty, but with all this pressure bearing"
" down on me..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* I did not see myself having the energy to discuss "
"such a topic."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Still.\n"
"* I have not given up on our future."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* No matter what happens to me, or my own well-being..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* At least monsterkind will go free one day."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* That is what matters now, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* ... I suppose... it would be a good time to end the "
"call now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* There is not much else for me to say."

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* (My time as a guard is long gone, but still, I felt so proud"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* (Of course, I taught them all they know.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* (In the end, they formed the council of dogs to make all "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* (Everyone gets belly rubs and treats for their hard work!)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Huh?\n"

"* Did I see someone MOVE!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Oh, it's just you."

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Wait, who are you talking to!?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* (I think Doggo wants to talk to you.)\n"
"* (Good luck!)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Give me that thing!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* ...\n"
"* So it's you, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* You're the one who thought it'd be funny to pet us all!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Not that... I'm complaining."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* But... argh!\n"
"* I couldn't even see you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* That was so unfair."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Except for Doge.\n"
"* She's really hard to pet."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I wonder what her secret is..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* You're the one who thought you could get past us by throwing"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I mean, OK, it worked."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But it was really annoying when I found out!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Maybe..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ... we can play again sometime?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* No, no, forget I said that.\n"
"* I shouldn't indulge in my fantasies this much."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* You're the one who tried to beat us all up!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* You even managed to disappoint Canis Major..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* What's wrong with you!?\n"
"* You're awful!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ... that's what the others would say."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* At least you made Canis Major happy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* So, maybe you're not all bad?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ... to be honest, I didn't mind it..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* You're the one who pet me when I couldn't even see you!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I bet you thought that was really funny."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I bet I looked really cute."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ... no, wait, I didn't mean that!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Wow!\n"

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But... that's just a fantasy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* You're the one who tried to beat me up!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* That was really rude.\n"
"* And mean."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I definitely didn't like that."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Anyway!\n"
"* Did you hear about the humans we released!?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* They were all asleep in some weird archive thing.\n"
"* It's way above my paw grade."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* All I know is, I get to take care of a human!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* It was Canis Maximus's idea.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* They're like pets???"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Don't worry, we don't mistreat them.\n"
"* They're under our protection!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Which is weird... since we were like, trying to hunt them "

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Still, they kind of have to be."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* People really seem to dislike humans these days.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* But times change.\n"

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* What the...\n"

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* after that, alphys fled the citadel and left us without"

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* you'd think the former queen might return, or..."

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* why?\n"

msgid ""
"<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* regardless, i realized it'd be up to me to do "

msgid "<32>* ... would you like me to tell you a joke?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* i don't have much of a sense of humor, but i can try..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* okay...\n"
"* here goes..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* if a ghost gets tired in the middle of the road, what does it do?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* answer... it {@fill:#ff0}naps to block{@fill:#fff} you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* get it?\n"
"* napstablook?\n"
"* naps to block?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* yeah...\n"
"* that was kinda bad"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ... you wanted me to tell you another joke?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* hmm... let me think about it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* okay, let's see..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* if a ghost changed vessels so they could have a child, what would you "
"call it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* answer... a {@fill:#ff0}trans-parent.{@fill:#fff}."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... heh."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ... you wanted me to tell you a third joke?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* well... if you insist..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* okay.\n"
"* i've got it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* if a restaurant hires a ghost to taste test their food, what does that"
" make the ghost?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* answer... a {@fill:#ff0}food-in-spectre.{@fill:#fff}."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* alright, alright.\n"
"* maybe i got a little carried away with that one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* but i hope you liked it anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* oh..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... i guess i'm at a loss for what to say."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* you've been such a good listener, i'd feel bad if i ran out of ideas."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* c'mon, blooky, think..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... what can you talk about..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* wait, hold on"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* do you know anything about ghost food?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* that last joke kind of got me thinking about it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* you must be confused... it's not really explained anywhere."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* if you like, i can tell you about it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* ... so, ghost food..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* it's exactly like normal monster food, except..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* when preparing it..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* there's a special kind of spell you have to use to make it edible for "
"ghosts."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* that's right... any monster food can become ghost food."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* as it turns out, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* certain kinds of food are easier to convert than others."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* like... standard fruit.\n"
"* or milkshakes."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* but something like that exoberry pie you bought from me..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* but something like that exoberry pie i had in my shop..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* that... would take a lot of magical power to make."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* the more complicated the food, the more difficult it is to convert "
"into ghost food."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* this one time, my... er, mettaton made me a chocolate "
"cake."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* this one time, my cousin made me a chocolate cake."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* chocolate filling, chocolate icing... chocolate everything."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* if i didn't know any better, i'd think it was actual human food."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* but somehow, he managed to convert all of that into a ghost food..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* not for a special occasion, but just because he wanted to see me "
"smile."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* but somehow, they managed to convert all of that into a ghost food..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* not for a special occasion, but just because they wanted to see me "
"smile."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* well... i did.\n"
"* and we ate the cake together."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* and i was happy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* heh...\n"
"* i think i'm gonna pretend to sleep for a while..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* it helps me unwind after a long day like this one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... wait, it's morning..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* i guess that would make it a long night, then."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* days and nights...\n"
"* that's going to take some getting used to."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* well... thanks for talking to me, frisk"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* feel free to lay down next to me... if you like......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Zzz... Zzz..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* Zzz... Zzz..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* This ghost keeps saying 'z' out loud repeatedly, pretending "
"to sleep."
msgstr ""

msgid "* (Lay down next to it?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes"
msgstr "是"

msgid "No"
msgstr "否"

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* The ghost is still here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/napstablook}* oooooooooooo......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* this is really nice......"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* (You feel... something.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* oh, sorry... i should probably explain what this is..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* ...\n"
"* so, uh..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* i took your body...\n"
"* as a vessel..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* and now...... we inhabit the same space......"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* i don't know why, but the last human who tried this... really liked "
"it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* so..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* maybe you will too..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* well, we can stay like this as long as you don't try "
"to move."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* so...\n"
"* only try to move around when you want it to end, i guess."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/napstablook}* well...\n"
"* i hope you liked that..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* or at least found it kind of interesting..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* or something..."
msgstr ""

msgid "* (Are you ready to go outside?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (But you didn't feel like wasting your time here.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* The computer's offline, but there's an empty slot for a "
"computer chip."
msgstr ""

msgid "* (Insert the Computer Chip?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You decide not to insert.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Ah!\n"
"* Thank you!\n"
"* Thank you so much!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* You really took care of me!\n"
"* You have found a computer very far away indeed!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I have established a link between this computer and my body on the "
"outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I never could have imagined how it would feel to exist in two places "
"at once!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It is... incredible..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I shall not forget this deed, fellow traveler!"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* A few more hours."

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* So this is your room, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Kind of strange..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... but who am I kidding, this is you we're talking about."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You'd sleep in a doggy bed if you had the choice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And you'd eat the dog food."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* And you'd like it if somebody tried to pet you whilst eating said dog "
"food."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I'd offer you a treat, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Even with my new ability to appear visually, I'm still just a ghost."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You'll have to settle for ghost dog treats, I'm afraid."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Oh, right.\n"
"* My new ability."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I tried showing myself to Asriel like before, but he couldn't see "
"me..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* So it looks like it only works for you right now."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Still.\n"
"* Better than nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* At least you can actually walk up to and talk to me now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Like that, for example."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Or that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Or even that!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* You can stop now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* There's more to your room than me, isn't there?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Maybe not."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Maybe I'm all you've got."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* In which case..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* We'll be here for a long time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* A very long time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* A very, very long time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* A very, very long time indeed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Don't you have anything better to do?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Ah, the humble hallway."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* For Asriel and I, it was the starting point of countless adventures..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* ... running dauntlessly across the various rooms of the house."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I know, right?\n"
"* So very adventurous."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Sadly, we had to stop after the mirror got smashed in for the seven "
"hundredth time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You wouldn't believe the excuses I'd come up with..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* Like when I blamed a particle collider for shooting a stray atom from "
"Earth to the outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* And somehow only hitting the glass because it \"phased\" through the "
"wall."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Yeah... that one might've been a stretch."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Nowadays, though, hallways are just hallways."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And excuses are just excuses."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Is there a valuable life lesson in there somewhere?\n"
"* Probably."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I will say, there's a kind of symbolism to a ghost in a hallway..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* With the whole \"between one place and another\" thing going on."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Actually, that probably only applies to human ghosts."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Monster ghosts are just born like that naturally..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* So, if anything, they'd be in the room at the beginning of the "
"hallway..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... rather than standing in the middle of it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Sorry.\n"
"* Went on a tangent there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* But what did you expect me to go on when you spoke to me in a boring "
"hallway?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* Boring hallway, boring tangent.\n"
"* That makes sense, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Or maybe it doesn't.\n"
"* What do I know."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Apart from the fact that I've run out of things to say."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* That, I know for sure."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But what can you do?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* ... wait, I know!\n"
"* We could go to a new room!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Ooh... Asgore's room."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The big guy sure loves his diaries, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Even though he hasn't written anything into that one yet, I'm sure "
"he'll do so soon."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Reading them has always been a guilty pleasure of mine..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* What?\n"
"* Everyone's got some kind of guilty pleasure, don't they?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I wonder what yours would be..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Maybe I'll find out later."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* For now, though, I'll just be hanging around."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Watching, waiting..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* ... ready to catch you the moment you do something you don't want me "
"to see!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Okay, maybe I wouldn't actually go that far."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>{#p/basic}* Not while you're awake, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I took a peek outside, and they're STILL working on "
"construction."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The whole front of the house is STILL a big mess."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And Asgore's... STILL tending to the ground..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* ... while the former CORE workers take their sweet, sweet time "
"building the porch."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I wonder what it'll look like when it's done..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Hopefully, with Asgore in charge, it'll look better than what we've "
"had before."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Actually, Asgore's only in charge of the design."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Since construction started yesterday, Doge has been the one giving the"
" orders."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I snuck outside then, too."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* She's strict, but she seems to know what she's doing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Which is great, because as much as I love Asgore for who he is..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He most certainly is NOT your ideal foreman."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>{#p/basic}* Speaking of things being built, they finished the balcony "
"earlier this morning."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Monster Kid and Asriel are both outside...\n"
"* ... sightseeing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* They sure do that a lot together... they're probably waiting for you "
"to join them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Once you're done taking in YOUR surroundings, you could go see them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* Or you could just go back to your room.\n"
"* Whatever floats your hoverboat."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Oh yeah, about boats..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I guess those aren't really needed around here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* But... Frisk!\n"
"* There are places on this world you can't be without one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Especially the bog basins.\n"
"* All that murky water..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Just keep it in mind."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* And no, you can't just get by swimming in those kinds of "
"places."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* Only some of them.\n"
"* And only at a good time of day."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Mind you, do monsters even have a sense of the time of day?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Most WERE born in space..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* ... maybe that's a question for another time of day."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Three little chairs at the dining table..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* One for you, one for Asriel, and one for Monster Kid."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* That's fine, really.\n"
"* Asgore wouldn't know I'm here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Still..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It does feel strange not to have a place there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Asriel and I loved to swap the chairs around when Mom wasn't"
" looking."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Even Asgore would get in on it sometimes.\n"
"* She... wasn't impressed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But it was all in good fun."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Heck, he used to check under Asriel's chair for space creatures when "
"he sat down."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I'll never forget that time Toriel sat down on the chair, which we "
"swapped beforehand..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* Asgore gave her the exact same treatment, and it was GLORIOUS."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* All of us were laughing... except for Toriel, who sat there in "
"disbelief."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Well.\n"
"* She came around to it later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* But, yeah... she wasn't much for the chicanery we got up to."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And even if she won't be here all the time..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And although she probably won't visit here much at all..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* It's a good thing Asriel's got someone like you to calm him down."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* When he gets excited, he gets REALLY excited."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... or, used to, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I guess it's unfair to think of him as the same person he "
"once was."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* With all that stuff he mentioned about trying to corrupt you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* With all that stuff he mentioned about hurting you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He's probably a very different person by now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Not unlike myself."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I just hope he can make the best of what he has, now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And that you'll be there for him when he needs you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But I guess I'm starting to repeat myself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* We've got a home, we've got sunlight... so there's no reason to "
"complain!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... or something like that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Of course they put a microwave in here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Of course they did."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* No doubt that'll be Asriel's primary source of food."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Yeah, he's what you'd call a \"microwave master.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I mean, it's bad enough that so many of our ingredients are "
"replicated these days..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Formed with matter-energy conversion nonsense, rather than legitimate "
"cooking."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But at least that can still produce something palletable."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Using the microwave is just..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's wrong."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's so very wrong."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>{#p/basic}* I mean, that's just my opinion."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* You can feel free to disagree, and knowing you, you probably do..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But some opinions..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Let's just say some opinions are more correct than others."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* All we can hope for is that Eurybia has a better selection "
"of fresh ingredients."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Considering Alphys was the one to seek out planets in the first "
"place..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You can't blame me for being at least a little wary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>{#p/basic}* If Asriel's a microwave master, Alphys would be a microwave "
"overlord."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That's all I'm saying."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* No, really."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Won't say anything more."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Not in the kitchen, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* The balcony's just outside..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I wonder if the birds are saying anything interesting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* Like \"what a nice house!\"\n"
"* Or \"the weather's great today.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Maybe they don't like the house OR the weather.\n"
"* That'd be... kind of sad."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Maybe they're not even birds.\n"
"* Who knows what kinds of sounds birds make here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Who knows if birds even exist here at all."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* For all we know, what we're hearing are the cries of the damned buried"
" deep underground."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* After the monsters have lived here long enough, the planet "
"might gain some form of magic."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* If that happens, would the animals be affected, too?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Would they become conscious?\n"
"* Understand us?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Would we understand them?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* If the sounds we're hearing really ARE cries of the damned, I'm not "
"sure I'd want to know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* But yeah, planetary magic."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I think that's what happened to Krios, when monsters first gained "
"THEIR magic."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Either that, or the planet already had magic, and gave it to them."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* We'd have to ask Terrestria about that sort of thing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* She'd know."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Hey.\n"
"* Don't be nervous about going out there, Frisk."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'm sure those two would be happy to see you there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And if my analysis of the position is right..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The planet itself will, too."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Don't quote me on that, though."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'm not much of a chess player."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* The smartest move I've ever played in a board game was a "
"double-jump in checkers."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It was downhill from there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* And if we weren't buried in a jungle, it might be downhill "

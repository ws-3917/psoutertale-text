msgid "<25>{#f/9}{#v/0}* Good luck!"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* I mean, you went almost the whole way without killing anyone..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* But somewhere along the line, you screwed up."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* All that good karma you had went straight down the toilet."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Golly, you can't do anything right!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}{#v/1}* What a joke!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Maybe that's why you killed those other monsters."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* I mean, you had a good run, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* What's the point in mercy if it doesn't mean anything?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* And believe me, after you did what you did..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/1}* It doesn't mean JACK."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* What's wrong with killing Toriel, huh?\n* Too good for that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}{#v/1}* I know you're still rotten to the core."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* I mean, you managed to take out everyone in your path..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* But when it came to the final hurdle, you failed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* Back again, huh?\n* Golly..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* You've changed the timeline around so much..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* I don't even know what to think now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* Are you good?\n* Evil?\n* Just curious?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* I dunno."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* There is one thing, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* One thing I KNOW you haven't done yet."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/1}* That's right."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}{#v/1}* You haven't killed everyone here in one run yet."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Aren't you at least a LITTLE curious?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* Come on, $(name)..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* I know you're in there somewhere."

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* Whatever.\n* Doesn't matter."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* You KNOW what you have to do, $(name)."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* I'll be waiting."

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* ...I have not even gotten back to the house yet!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Please, wait a moment before calling again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* That is the pathway to the local taxi stop."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* From there, you can access other areas of the outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I don't know the taxi driver very well..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* They can be a bit, er, mysterious."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* You must be in the residential wing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* That area is home to several monsters..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Including a few who have lived there since the early days."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The monsters there do not often leave the lower level."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I have tried to encourage them to explore..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Perhaps they are content with the status quo."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Oh, that is where Napstablook often stays!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Their company is always nice, even if they do not see it that way."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I have tried comforting them on several occasions..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Nothing seems to cheer them up for long."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I suspect someone else is to blame for their wallows..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Although, lately they have seemed happier..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I do hope their good moods continue."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The OUTLANDS bridge, hmm?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* And to think I was about to..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, there is nothing to worry about now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Carry on, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Greetings!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I can see you standing outside from my window."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* What brings you back here so soon?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* How long have you been standing out there!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Did you come back all this way just to call me again?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/14}* My child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/14}* It... it is nice to see you again..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* Umm..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oh dear, is the vending machine broken again?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* ...\n* I apologize for that, my child."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* That vending machine has broken down more times than I can count."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I fear much of the technology around here is out of date..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Perhaps it's time I replace some of it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Ah, you must be in my front yard."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, I call it it a yard."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It is more of a junction between my home and the exit."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* That room was originally going to be larger..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Then, we realized there would be no use for the extra space."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Interesting, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The very edge of the outpost..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Are you feeling nostalgic, my child?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Or perhaps you are looking for something..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, in any case, please do not stay out for too long."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* You would not want to forget the way back!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oho, I know where you are..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The ambient noise of that room is unmistakable."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* Not to mention, that terminal was much too tall for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Well, most of the terminals in the OUTLANDS are short..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* How odd. That particular one happened to be different."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I must say, I am not proud of how I dealt with that Froggit..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* That could have been a great learning exercise!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I suppose there is no sense in worrying about it now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The past cannot changed, after all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The DUMMY room...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Hee hee, I am still proud of the way you handled that test."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Talking it out is preferable to violence..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Even when it seems unrealistic."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Although you did not handle that test well..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I am sure you learned from it going forward."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* That was the idea, was it not...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Oh, how could I forget the way you ran..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Perhaps you were not ready for a battle at the time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Although, considering what happened between us..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I highly doubt it is an issue for you now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Truthfully, I still do not know how to react to what happened."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It was mesmerising to watch, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Just... the two of you... staring at each other..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Ah, how could I forget how adorable you were..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I have taught many... erm, monsters, how to handle FIGHTs."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* None of them ever did it quite like you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I would even go as far as to say you had the better idea!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* The next time you come across a dummy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Slapping them might not be a great idea."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* Or it is a great idea, and I am simply the crazy one here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Who knows!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* Hahahahaha!\n* Ah- I could not hold in the laughter!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Never in my life did I expect you to FLIRT..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Let alone like the way you did!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Listen to me, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Flirting with your adversaries is almost never ideal."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* But YOU..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* You seem to have a knack for it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Maybe you could use that to your advantage at some point."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* That is where I introduced myself to you, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Who would have thought you would come all this way."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I suppose there is not much else to say."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Are you leaving the OUTLANDS, my child?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I want you to remember something."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Whatever happens out there, no matter how bad it is..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I want you to know that I have faith in you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I know you want to continue to do the right thing, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I know you can."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* So, remember that for me, alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I love you, little one..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Good luck."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Ah, the room I did not want you to enter."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* And for good reason..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It is where you tend to run into the more, erm, \"active\" monsters."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Ones that believe it is their duty to defend the kingdom."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* While they have every right to do so..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* That does not mean I have to agree with it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* That is perhaps the least interesting room in the OUTLANDS."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* However, even boring rooms do have their history..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* At one time, that area was going to be the community centre..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Given that it is only a few steps away from the taxi stop."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* But, over time, our plans for the area changed..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Now it is nothing more than a simple junction point."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I do wonder..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Did they ever fix the power lines in that room?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, perhaps I should go take a look at that sometime."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Are those Froggits STILL sitting there?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* They never seem to be anywhere else..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Truly, it is an odd way to live."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* How does one eat?\n* How does one drink?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* We may never know the answers to these questions, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Is that the sound of the club house...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Hee hee, they host performances there from time to time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Music, drama, and the arts, of course..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It is always good to see people expressing themselves."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I once attended a comedy show there..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It was the hardest I have ever laughed in my life!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* That area is almost never visited by anyone..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Truthfully, there is a good reason for that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It is the same reason there is a locked door nearby."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Perhaps it would be best if we did not discuss it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Ah, the lower level."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I do not visit that area often, mainly because..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I get nervous about falling through."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* That glass... it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* This silly old woman simply cannot help but worry about it!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* My child, what are you doing in a storage closet!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* ...\n* Let me guess."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Are you one of those who believe in \"dark worlds?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Silly child.\n* You will not find any worlds like that here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Ah, that must be your room!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I really do hope you like it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Well, I say YOUR room..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Perhaps it is no longer as such."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Still, I am glad that you could get some rest."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Did you know that my home used to have a basement?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* In fact, it used to lead to the exit of the OUTLANDS."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* However, there were issues with the gravity in that section, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Well, we do not want monsters floating away, do we?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* My, that would be terrible!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* There is not much to say about the hallway..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Hmm, that unrenovated room could certainly use some work."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I suppose when I built this colorful replica of the royal house..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I did not get around to completing that room."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Do you know why there is so much fur in my sink?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* You see, lately, I had to shed quite a bit of mine."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* You can imagine where all of that ended up."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* What? This is perfectly normal for boss monsters."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* There is no need to call me when I am right here, little one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Rummaging around in the living room, are we?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Do not worry, I do not mind at all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Say, have you read all of the books on the bookshelves?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* There is so much interesting material!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Oh, that is my favorite puzzle room!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* ...that sounded better in my head."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/1}* But there is something nice about how it teaches collaboration..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Oh, I sound like a veritable scholar!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Well, actually, my dream job is to become a caregiver."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* There is just something rewarding about helping children grow."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* That is where I found you, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* To think you could have been killed by that awful thing..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* He has been a pest here for some time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I do wonder where he came from..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Perhaps there are other talking starlings out there...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* All alone out there, by yourself..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It is a good thing I was there to bring you in."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Who knows what awful things could have happened otherwise..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Although it is just a simple taxi stop..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I often see monsters walk out there to take their mind off things."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I suppose, here in the OUTLANDS..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* We really can make anything multi-purpose."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* There is a reason why that room is so long and windy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The idea was that it would slow down invading human forces."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Can you imagine how difficult it would be..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* For an army of foot soldiers to traverse that path?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, that was the intention, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It seems that, in truth, we had nothing to worry about."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Calling this early...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* You should really get going, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I promise everything will be okay."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Be good, will you not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Have you met SANS?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I sure hope he and his brother are taking good care of you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Nothing less for such a sweet little bean!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oh, SANS..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* You must have several hilarious stories to tell about him."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* He may be an OLD SOUL..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* But he's got a real PENSION for humor!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* An old landing pad?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* From your description, it sounds like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Like the pad I helped set up for the early Starton engineers!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* At the time, Starton was our biggest project to date."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Workers complained about long commutes to the build site..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* So we threw in a spacecraft landing pad for quick access!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Progress on Starton sped up quite a ways, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* ...um, am I rambling again?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* SANS has told me all about his brother's fondness for puzzles."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I hear he has even created some of his own...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It sounds exciting."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I would love to try one sometime!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Alas, I must oversee these OUTLANDS..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Please, can somebody explain \"dog marriage?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* It is an odd phrase I continue to hear at least once per week."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I do know of one little puppy that likes to visit the OUTLANDS..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* But \"marriage\" would imply at least two dogs."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Hmm..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Hmm..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* I wonder what kind of food is sold in Starton these days."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Cakes?\n* Pies?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well.\n* I sure hope it is nice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/15}* It better not be rationed ice cream."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* SANS's fondness for spot-the-difference puzzles..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Has always been confusing to me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Knowing him, I get the strangest feeling..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* That there is more to it than meets the eye."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Or, eye-socket in his case, I suppose.\n* Hee hee."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Why would someone want to solve a near- impossible puzzle?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* SANS never stops talking about his brother's spaghetti."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* But just imagine the PASTABILITIES..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Rigatoni!\n* Fettuccine!\n* Acini Di Pepe!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Some variety could really help him go FARFALLE."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Go BIGOLI or go home, as they say!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Math is certainly not my favorite subject..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* ...but it does make for a good puzzle!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Umm... most of the time, it does."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* But umm..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Who has time for that, anyway?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* To my knowledge, ALPHYS is the current royal scientist."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* She may never replace the brilliance of sir ROMAN..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* But I am sure her skills are more than up to the task."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* This may surprise you, but I have a certain respect for scientists."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Such analytical minds!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* If I were you, I would steer clear of dubious salesfolk."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* You never know what strings they may pull..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* A lesson I have had to learn the hard way, unfortunately."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* It is fortunate most of Starton is outdoors."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Otherwise, I would not be able to take your calls!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* My, I should think about getting an upgrade."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* With quality this wooden, it is a wonder we can call at all..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* You must have crossed into town by now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* What do you think?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Napstablook often tells of how friendly it is..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I am glad that such an environment could be fostered out there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* SANS says his house is on the south side of town."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Last I checked, there were no \"sides\" to town..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The town I remember was one large square."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Chirp, chirp, chirp..."

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Being trapped there is not a memory I like to revisit."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* For all the dark and dingy places in that factory..."

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I take it you have been in Aerialis for a while now?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Hee hee.\n* Exploration is not such a bad thing!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Just be sure not to turn purple like the rest of the place."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/4}* It is a very serious condition, my child."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* The royal lab is such a great place to learn."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Being the home of so many breakthroughs, it is quite storied."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* If I ever become a teacher, I would host a field trip here!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* With ALPHYS's permission of course."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I wonder if Aerialis is still full of scaffolding..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* They should have finished the project by now..."

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* He is still looking after you, is he not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* That, or he has once again started selling corn dogs."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Why do I get the feeling it is the latter."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Silly skeleton."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* When hearing about your hijinks with METTATON..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I had a thought."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* How could a robot like him exist after our ban on AI programs?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Surely ALPHYS would not break such a well- established rule..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* There must be some other explanation."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* A fountain?\n* I do not remember any fountains out there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Then again, I have been away for a long time..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I am sure I would be very surprised if I came out there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I wonder what other wild things they have built!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Spire houses, perhaps?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Be wary of abandoned side pathways in Aerialis."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* You may find secrets you wish you had not stumbled upon..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* If you enter the rec center, I will not be able to reach you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Past the rec center is the CORE... and the CITADEL."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* This could very well be the last time I hear from you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* Please, young one... be good, won't you?"

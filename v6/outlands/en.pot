msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* An old fuel injection device."

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* A world not bound by association..."

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* There is another puzzle in this room."

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I wonder if you can solve it?"

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* This terminal's staggering height towers over you, blocking your eager approach."

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* What is the problem?\n* Do you need assistance?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/7}* Oh-... oh my."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* It seems there is a bit of a design fault here.\n* Hee hee."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Now now, no need to worry..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I can enter the password for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Perhaps you still want to try to solve its riddle?"
msgstr ""

msgid "* (Solve the riddle?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Excellent!\n* I was hoping you would say that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* The willingness to learn and grow is important..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Especially for a youngster such as yourself."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* So, here is the riddle..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* \"What's baked like a cake and rhymes with a lie?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (Despite your best efforts, you struggle to understand...)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* Why would Toriel hand out such an easy question?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It boggles the mind."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You tell Toriel the answer.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/7}* ...Pie?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* That's correct!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I must say, I did not expect you to solve it so easily..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* But I am all the more grateful for it!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* (Even when conjouring all your mental might...)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* (Even when considering the many truths and stratagems you've learned over time...)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* (Nothing.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* Who devised such a question?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Who in their right mind would desire to cause such cereberal anguish..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...in those who attempt to solve this unwavering mystery?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Alas, it matters not."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Your inability to solve this riddle is absolute."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Perhaps if your conscience was a little clearer, maybe things would be different."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You tell Toriel you do not know the answer.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* If you cannot solve the riddle, that is alright."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I do not want to pressure you, after all..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Especially if it is something you are not quite ready for."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I suppose I can solve this one for you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* That is alright."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* And... {#x1}there!\n* The way is clear."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Once ready, you may enter the next room."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You got the little dipper.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You ring the buzzer...)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* There doesn't seem to be anyone here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* The door is unlocked."
msgstr ""

msgid "* (Take a peek inside?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* The sound of distant chatter can be heard."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The door is locked and barricaded from the inside."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* The sound of cries and confusion can be heard from within."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/13}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* I wonder if that old photo of us is still in there..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Nothing of value in there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Seems this room is full of old, dusty trinkets..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...and an old photo of..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Of... um..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Maybe you shouldn't look in this room."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You decide not to look.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* ...but everybody ran."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* ...but nobody came."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* You think dropping people's food in front of them is funny?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* Hey!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Pies are for eating, not dropping on the ground..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* How could you do that to those poor fried snails..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#n1}* Aww c'mon! ;)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I poured my heart into that! ;)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#n1}* Seriously!? ;)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That steak was utterly priceless! ;)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* In this room, I have a special training exercise."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* As a human who has just arrived here, monsters may attack you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* In this situation, you will enter a FIGHT."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Do not worry, the process in any FIGHT is simple..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Strike up a friendly conversation to stall for time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* I will come to resolve the conflict."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* For now, practice talking to the DUMMY."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Do you need any conversation topics?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Hmm..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Oh, I know!\n* Why not talk about how you arrived here?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I am sure your story is quite intriguing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* There is nothing to be afraid of."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* A simple DUMMY cannot hurt you, can it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Now go on, give it a try..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Go on, give it a try..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* My child, the DUMMY is not for FIGHTing!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* We don't want to hurt anyone, do we?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Come now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Ah, very good!\n* You are very good."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oh, you... you ran away..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* In truth, that was not a bad choice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Staying out of trouble is... preferable, to FIGHTing anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* However, that was only a DUMMY."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It has no desire for revenge..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Never mind.\n* Stay close to me, and I will protect you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The next room awaits."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* The next room awaits!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/7}* Oh my..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* You are adorable, my child!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* In any case, we shall continue forward."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* The next room awaits!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* My goodness, child!\n* Have mercy!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Fortunately, that was only a DUMMY."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* But in the future, please..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Try not to slap your opponents half to death, will you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Come now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Quite tasty, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* And considering what I went through to bake it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It better be."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Are you enjoying your breakfast?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, I hope it sufficed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* Aaron pulled out his phone and snapped a picture."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#n1}* Ooh, I could definitely put this on a billboard. ;)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* Aaron shot you with a wink."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#n1}* You like the product, lassy? ;)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* Not again..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* Who does he think he is?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You've been nothing but kind to everyone we've met."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That talking star really needs to get a life..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/12}* You idiot..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Didn't you hear me before!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* I thought I told you not to screw it up!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Now look what you've done to our plan."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* You better fix this, $(name)."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* It's our destiny."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}* Howdy, $(name)."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* I've had some time to think about what happened."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* It was thrilling, at first..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* The thought of taking the outpost by force together..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* But now, I'm not sure."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* I guess... I got a bit carried away back there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* But that's okay, right?\n* You'll forgive me, won't you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* I should be going now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* Good luck on your travels, $(name)..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I'll be back before you know it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* Sorry, did I miss something somewhere?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I've never talked to him in my life, let alone go on some mission with him."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Oh well.\n* It wouldn't be the first time he's made up stories about me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/5}{#v/0}* Clever.\n* Verrrryy clever."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* You think you're really smart, don'tcha?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Hee hee hee..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/1}* In this world, it's KILL or BE killed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* If you had just killed a FEW more monsters..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}{#v/0}* Well, maybe I shouldn't reveal my plans this early."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* You know, $(name)..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/1}* It's only a matter of time before we're together again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* Try a little harder next time, and maybe..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* You'll get to see something new."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Until we meet again..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* If you had just killed ONE more monster..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* So you made it through without killing anyone."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* So you spared the life of everyone you came across."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* I bet you feel really great."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}{#v/1}* But what will you do if you meet a serial murderer?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}{#v/0}* You'll die, and you'll die, and you'll die..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* And eventually, you'll tire of trying."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* What then, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}{#v/1}* Will you KILL out of frustration?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}{#v/1}* Or will you simply GIVE UP?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/1}* This is gonna be SO much fun."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}{#v/0}* I'll be watching!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* So you spared the life of a single person."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* But what about everyone else, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Froggit, Flutterlyte, Gelatini, Silente, Oculoux, Mushy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* Don'tcha think any of them have families?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* Don'tcha think any of them have friends?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* Each one could've been someone else's Toriel."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/1}* Selfish brat."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/1}* Someone's dead because of you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/1}* Monsters are dead because of you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/5}{#v/0}* I'm sure you're well aware of that, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* Considering you've already killed Toriel once before."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Ain't that right, brat?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/1}* You MURDERED her."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* And then, you felt bad...\n* Ain't that right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Do you think you're the only one with that power?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* The power to reshape the world, purely by your own will..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* The power to SAVE..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* That used to be MY power, you know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* Seems YOUR desires for this world override MINE."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* Well then.\n* Enjoy that power while you can."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/0}* They're all gone now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* What's Toriel gonna do when she finds out, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}{#v/1}* What if she KILLS herself out of loneliness, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* If you think you're saving her just by SPARING her..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Then you're even dumber than I thought."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Well, see ya!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* After all, this used to be MY power."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* I thought I was the only one who could do that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/11}{#v/0}* You're one hell of a tease, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* Beating monsters within an inch of their lives, only to let them go..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* What will you do if a monster doesn't WANT your mercy?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/1}* Will you snuff the light out of their eyes?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Or will you realize your faulty \"pacifism\" is for nothing?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Hee hee hee."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/0}{#v/1}* Wow, you're utterly repulsive."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* You spared her life..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Then, you figured that wasn't good enough for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}{#v/1}* So you KILLED her just to see what would happen."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/0}* You did it out of BOREDOM."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Don't think I don't know how this works..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* It's sad, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/11}{#v/0}* Look at you, playing with her life like this..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Killing her, sparing her, killing her again..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}{#v/0}* Sparing her, killing her, sparing her again..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* It's fun, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}{#v/0}* Endlessly toying with the lives of others..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* Watching how they react to every possible decision..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Isn't it thrilling?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}{#v/0}* I wonder what you'll do next."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* I'll be watching..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/10}{#v/1}* You just can't get enough, can you~"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* How many more times will you KILL her, eh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/1}* You kinda remind me of myself."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}{#v/0}* Well, cya!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* Again?\n* Golly..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}{#v/1}* You REALLY remind me of myself."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* Again!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}{#v/0}* Wow, you're even worse than I thought."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/twinkly}{#f/5}{#v/0}* So you've finally decided show mercy, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}{#v/0}* And after all that KILLING..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}{#v/0}* Say, was this your idea all along?"

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* I did not want to say this, but..."

msgid "<25>{#f/11}* I cannot allow you to continue on this path."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* For your own sake, child..."

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/14}* Ha...\n* Haha..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* Perhaps it was always meant to come to this."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Perhaps I was foolish to think that you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* Well, you leave me with little choice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* I am sorry, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}* But I cannot allow you to leave."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* After you return to Toriel's home, she destroys the bridge to the outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Time goes by, and Toriel soon realizes what you've done."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Her view on humanity shattered, and with nothing else left, she decides to..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* M-Meanwhile, the remaining residents of the outpost are suffering..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Still trapped within the force field, with no means of escape..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And, given the circumstances, there likely never will be."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Is this really the best outcome you could ask for?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Is this what they really deserve?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Time goes by, and Toriel does her best to care for you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...despite those who've gone missing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Meanwhile, the residents of the outpost are suffering..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Time goes by, and Toriel does her best to care for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Reading books, baking pies, telling stories...\n* And hugs, of course."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Meanwhile, the residents of the outpost are suffering."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Sorry about the delay, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* It appears that little white dog has raided my kitchen again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* You should see the state of that pie..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Fortunately, you got your slice before that happened."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Anyway, I have prepared a plate of fried snails just for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Voila, breakfast is ready!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* I have prepared a plate of fried snails just for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* I will leave them on the table for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* For some reason, there is a brand-name chocolate bar in the fridge."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Do you want to try it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "* (Take the chocolate?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You let the chocolate bar be.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You got the chocolate bar.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* There's nothing of value in there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}* ...just don't know if we can let them in, Ma'am..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I promise you, this child will be on their best behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}* Are you sure?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Positive."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Alright, I trust you.\n* Looking forward to seeing them, I guess."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* How long have you been standing there!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I suppose it matters not."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* From now on, you should not have to deal with any more FIGHTs."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Oh, and the party club is now open to visitors!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* If you ever get bored of wandering, please..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Take the time to visit them."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/3}* In other news, that little white dog has raided my kitchen again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Still, I have done my best to salvage it for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I hope you like it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It is not often they get to see new faces."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* That being said, I will be in the living room if you need me!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Good morning, little one!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* That little white dog has once again raided my kitchen."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It is a rather nice day today, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* At least, it has been so for me..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Anywho, I will be in the living room if you need me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Good morning, little one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* The OUTLANDS have been unusually silent today."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* No fussing, no bussing... nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Apart from the little white dog raiding my kitchen again, that is."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* In an odd way, it is... kind of peaceful."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Still, it would be nice if just one monster were to say hello..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/10}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/20}{*}* Come here- {%}"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/19}{*}* Come here- {%}"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* I am sorry for what I have put you through."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* In the end, I cannot keep you here against your will."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Although..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Tell you what."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* If you ever need someone to talk to out there..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Feel free to call me, at any time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* And if you need to return here for any reason..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I will do my best to accomedate you during your stay."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* I will miss you, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/14}* Be good, alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Be good, alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* You changed your mind..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* Perhaps you really are different from them..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/14}* ...well then."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I will finish up here, and meet you back at the house."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Thank you for listening, my child."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It means a lot to me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Forgive me, my child..."

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#n1}* We don't like your aggressive type 'round here..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#n1}* Eyy, this place is off limits..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#n1}* Not gonna letcha thru after what you've done, pal..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#n1}* Not gonna letcha thru, pal..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You got the halo.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* So far, we have learned how to solve puzzles and win battles."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Now, there is a far more important lesson you must learn."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Tell me, do you think you can make it to the end of this room..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* ...without my help?"
msgstr ""

msgid "* (What do you say?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Are you sure?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* It is only a short distance away..."
msgstr ""

msgid "* (Change your mind?)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Um..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It IS important to do things on your own, correct?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Alright then..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Good luck!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/10}* Worry not, my child."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* If you truly do not wish to leave my side, then..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I will guide you through the remainder of the OUTLANDS."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Take my hand, young one..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* We're going home."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (As Toriel escorts you home, her soothing grip...)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* Soon enough, you arrive at Toriel's home."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* For some reason, she feels the need to put you to bed right away."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* With a pat on the head, you begin to drift off to sleep."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Ah, you made it!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* My child, what took you so long??"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* Are you alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Hmm...\n* You do seem to be fine..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, regardless, it is good to see you again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Do not worry, you were never in any danger."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* This was merely a test of your independence, for you see..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I have some important errands to run."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* It is for this reason that I must leave you alone for a while."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* For your own safety, I advise you not to leave this room."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* There are a few puzzles I have yet to explain, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#s/equip}{#f/0}* Well, in the meantime, I will give you a CELL PHONE."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* If you need anything, please..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Do not hesitate to call."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Be good, alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Hello!\n* This is TORIEL."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* My errands are taking longer than I thought they would."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* You must wait a little longer."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Oh, and...\n* Thank you for being patient..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* You are a very good child."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Hello...\n* This is TORIEL."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I found what I was looking for..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* But a small, white puppy snatched it away!\n* How odd."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Do dogs even like flour?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Err, that is an unrelated question, of course."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Regardless, it will take a little longer for me to return."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Thanks again for being so patient."

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}* (...)"

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* Stop, please!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Come back here with my CELL PHONE!"

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}* (Snore... snore...)"

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Hellooo?\n* Little puppy...?"

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (The snoring stops.)"

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (The snoring resumes.)"

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}* (Achoo!)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (It sounds like a small, white dog sneezing in its sleep.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* (You hear a distant voice.)"

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/8}* Hee hee, there is no escape!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Hello...\n* This is... TORIEL..."

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* No, bad puppy!"

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}* (Whimper... whimper...)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* There, there...\n* I will find another CELL PHONE for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Does that sound good?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#s/bark}{#p/event}* Bark!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Ah, I am glad to hear it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (The dog could be heard walking away.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Please, forgive me for all of this nonsense."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It is not every day a dog steals your CELL PHONE..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Anywho, I will be back to pick you up shortly."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* See you soon."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Hello?\n* This is TORIEL."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* You have not left the room, have you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* There are many dangers out there, and I do not want you to get hurt."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Take care of yourself, alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* So much for being patient..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...eh, at least you waited a little before leaving the room."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/narrator}* A few minutes later..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* I have returned!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* I am glad that you have been so patient with me, my child."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* It is not very often those your age behave this well."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* But now, it is time I took you home..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Please, allow me to lead the way!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Welcome to our humble outpost, innocent one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* This place may seem strange to you now, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* With time, and a little guidance, you will grow accustomed to it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Before that can begin, however, we must make it to the next room."

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I was acting on my own silly desires."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Though, I am sure you have already forgiven me..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The old puzzle rooms..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* They were originally designed to stop human intruders."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* As the years went by, and no humans came..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* They became less of a security measure and more of a tradition."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Now, solving these is just a part of our lives."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* I heard SANS's brother wants to join the royal guard someday."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Such an aspirational young skeleton..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Despite what I think of the guard, it is good to see someone dream."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Sometimes, I worry that too many have given up on their dreams..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* But not him!\n* That skeleton knows what is best for him."
msgstr ""

msgid "s_doggo"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* That sound..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Is that a builder bot!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* My, those old robots... what a past they have."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* That poor thing must be the last of its kind."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Still, it is nice to know that it has survived for this long."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Is the royal guard giving you too much trouble?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I did tell SANS to discourage them from FIGHTing you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I know that I should be more worried..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* But something tells me you will be alright."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It is like... instinct?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* If you ever decide to leave Starton, well..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* My CELL PHONE is old, and cannot reach many areas of the factory."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* You would be without me for a while..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* So please, take care of yourself, alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The Starton puzzles..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* They are surely altered now, but I never liked their original design."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* There were no written instructions anywhere!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* You are near the end of the factory, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Take heart.\n* There are brighter pastures up ahead."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Not to mention, my CELL phone will be able to reach you there!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* I should really get an upgrade..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Welcome to Aerialis."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Here you will find the royal lab and the newfound \"rec center.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I have never been to the rec center, but I hear it is nice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Perhaps you could call me again when you get there?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Maybe that way I could hear more about it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* I am afraid do not have much else to say about this area..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* I have heard the royal guards in Aerialis love salmon."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Or was it ice cream?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* Wait, no, I think it was pizza!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* All of which are in short supply on the outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* I wonder if humans still enjoy monster delicacies like these."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* What kind of puzzles do they have in Aerialis?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Are they laser-based?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Do they entangle you back to the start when you fail them?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* My, do we already have enough of that here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* I do not enjoy being moved against my will, thank you very much!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Word of your performances has spread far, little one!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I did not know you had such \"fabulous\" moves."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* I did not know you were such a daring spirit."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* I had no idea you were so skilled with a one- time use jetpack!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I did not know you had such a clever mind for prices."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* I look forward to seeing what you do next!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Barricades, hmm?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* My child. When it comes to getting through walls..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* I am not the one you should call."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Surely the royal scientist would be a better choice, no?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Individuals in that position, they um..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* They tend to become obsessed with getting through walls."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* I will never forget the time we first tried out the elevator."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* That music..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* ...was unspeakable."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Never again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* Please, do not tell me you actually enjoy it!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Although that place may not evoke the best of feelings for us..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It is still one of my favorite places in the OUTLANDS."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* There is someone I know who visits me here sometimes..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Perhaps you are already aware of him."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Calling so soon...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* ...I have not even gotten back to the house yet!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Please, wait a moment before calling again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* That is the pathway to the local taxi stop."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* From there, you can access other areas of the outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I don't know the taxi driver very well..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* They can be a bit, er, mysterious."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* You must be in the residential wing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* That area is home to several monsters..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Including a few who have lived there since the early days."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The monsters there do not often leave the lower level."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I have tried to encourage them to explore..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Perhaps they are content with the status quo."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Oh, that is where Napstablook often stays!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Their company is always nice, even if they do not see it that way."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I have tried comforting them on several occasions..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Nothing seems to cheer them up for long."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I suspect someone else is to blame for their wallows..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Although, lately they have seemed happier..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I do hope their good moods continue."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The OUTLANDS bridge, hmm?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* And to think I was about to..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, there is nothing to worry about now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Carry on, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Greetings!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I can see you standing outside from my window."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* What brings you back here so soon?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* How long have you been standing out there!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Did you come back all this way just to call me again?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/14}* My child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/14}* It... it is nice to see you again..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* Umm..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oh dear, is the vending machine broken again?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* ...\n* I apologize for that, my child."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* That vending machine has broken down more times than I can count."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I fear much of the technology around here is out of date..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Perhaps it's time I replace some of it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Ah, you must be in my front yard."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, I call it it a yard."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It is more of a junction between my home and the exit."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* That room was originally going to be larger..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Then, we realized there would be no use for the extra space."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Interesting, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The very edge of the outpost..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Are you feeling nostalgic, my child?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Or perhaps you are looking for something..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, in any case, please do not stay out for too long."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* You would not want to forget the way back!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oho, I know where you are..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The ambient noise of that room is unmistakable."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* Not to mention, that terminal was much too tall for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Well, most of the terminals in the OUTLANDS are short..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* How odd. That particular one happened to be different."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I must say, I am not proud of how I dealt with that Froggit..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* That could have been a great learning exercise!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I suppose there is no sense in worrying about it now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The past cannot changed, after all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The DUMMY room...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Hee hee, I am still proud of the way you handled that test."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Talking it out is preferable to violence..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Even when it seems unrealistic."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Although you did not handle that test well..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I am sure you learned from it going forward."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* That was the idea, was it not...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Oh, how could I forget the way you ran..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Perhaps you were not ready for a battle at the time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Although, considering what happened between us..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I highly doubt it is an issue for you now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Truthfully, I still do not know how to react to what happened."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It was mesmerising to watch, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Just... the two of you... staring at each other..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Ah, how could I forget how adorable you were..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I have taught many... erm, monsters, how to handle FIGHTs."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* None of them ever did it quite like you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I would even go as far as to say you had the better idea!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* The next time you come across a dummy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Slapping them might not be a great idea."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* Or it is a great idea, and I am simply the crazy one here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Who knows!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* Hahahahaha!\n* Ah- I could not hold in the laughter!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Never in my life did I expect you to FLIRT..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Let alone like the way you did!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Listen to me, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Flirting with your adversaries is almost never ideal."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* But YOU..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* You seem to have a knack for it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Maybe you could use that to your advantage at some point."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* That is where I introduced myself to you, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Who would have thought you would come all this way."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I suppose there is not much else to say."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Are you leaving the OUTLANDS, my child?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I want you to remember something."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Whatever happens out there, no matter how bad it is..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I want you to know that I have faith in you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I know you want to continue to do the right thing, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I know you can."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* So, remember that for me, alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I love you, little one..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Good luck."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Ah, the room I did not want you to enter."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* And for good reason..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It is where you tend to run into the more, erm, \"active\" monsters."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Ones that believe it is their duty to defend the kingdom."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* While they have every right to do so..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* That does not mean I have to agree with it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* That is perhaps the least interesting room in the OUTLANDS."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* However, even boring rooms do have their history..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* At one time, that area was going to be the community centre..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Given that it is only a few steps away from the taxi stop."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* But, over time, our plans for the area changed..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Now it is nothing more than a simple junction point."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I do wonder..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Did they ever fix the power lines in that room?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, perhaps I should go take a look at that sometime."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Are those Froggits STILL sitting there?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* They never seem to be anywhere else..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Truly, it is an odd way to live."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* How does one eat?\n* How does one drink?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* We may never know the answers to these questions, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Is that the sound of the club house...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Hee hee, they host performances there from time to time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Music, drama, and the arts, of course..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It is always good to see people expressing themselves."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I once attended a comedy show there..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It was the hardest I have ever laughed in my life!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* That area is almost never visited by anyone..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Truthfully, there is a good reason for that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It is the same reason there is a locked door nearby."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Perhaps it would be best if we did not discuss it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Ah, the lower level."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I do not visit that area often, mainly because..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I get nervous about falling through."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* That glass... it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* This silly old woman simply cannot help but worry about it!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* My child, what are you doing in a storage closet!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* ...\n* Let me guess."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Are you one of those who believe in \"dark worlds?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Silly child.\n* You will not find any worlds like that here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Ah, that must be your room!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I really do hope you like it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Well, I say YOUR room..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Perhaps it is no longer as such."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Still, I am glad that you could get some rest."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Did you know that my home used to have a basement?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* In fact, it used to lead to the exit of the OUTLANDS."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* However, there were issues with the gravity in that section, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Well, we do not want monsters floating away, do we?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* My, that would be terrible!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* There is not much to say about the hallway..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Hmm, that unrenovated room could certainly use some work."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I suppose when I built this colorful replica of the royal house..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I did not get around to completing that room."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Do you know why there is so much fur in my sink?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* You see, lately, I had to shed quite a bit of mine."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* You can imagine where all of that ended up."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* What? This is perfectly normal for boss monsters."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* There is no need to call me when I am right here, little one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Rummaging around in the living room, are we?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Do not worry, I do not mind at all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Say, have you read all of the books on the bookshelves?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* There is so much interesting material!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Oh, that is my favorite puzzle room!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* ...that sounded better in my head."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/1}* But there is something nice about how it teaches collaboration..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Oh, I sound like a veritable scholar!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Well, actually, my dream job is to become a caregiver."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* There is just something rewarding about helping children grow."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* That is where I found you, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* To think you could have been killed by that awful thing..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* He has been a pest here for some time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I do wonder where he came from..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Perhaps there are other talking starlings out there...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* All alone out there, by yourself..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It is a good thing I was there to bring you in."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Who knows what awful things could have happened otherwise..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Although it is just a simple taxi stop..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I often see monsters walk out there to take their mind off things."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I suppose, here in the OUTLANDS..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* We really can make anything multi-purpose."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* There is a reason why that room is so long and windy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The idea was that it would slow down invading human forces."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Can you imagine how difficult it would be..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* For an army of foot soldiers to traverse that path?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, that was the intention, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It seems that, in truth, we had nothing to worry about."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Calling this early...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* You should really get going, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I promise everything will be okay."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Be good, will you not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Have you met SANS?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I sure hope he and his brother are taking good care of you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Nothing less for such a sweet little bean!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oh, SANS..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* You must have several hilarious stories to tell about him."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* He may be an OLD SOUL..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* But he's got a real PENSION for humor!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* An old landing pad?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* From your description, it sounds like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Like the pad I helped set up for the early Starton engineers!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* At the time, Starton was our biggest project to date."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Workers complained about long commutes to the build site..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* So we threw in a spacecraft landing pad for quick access!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Progress on Starton sped up quite a ways, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* ...um, am I rambling again?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* SANS has told me all about his brother's fondness for puzzles."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I hear he has even created some of his own...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It sounds exciting."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I would love to try one sometime!"

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Alas, I must oversee these OUTLANDS..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Please, can somebody explain \"dog marriage?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* It is an odd phrase I continue to hear at least once per week."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I do know of one little puppy that likes to visit the OUTLANDS..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* But \"marriage\" would imply at least two dogs."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Hmm..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Hmm..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* I wonder what kind of food is sold in Starton these days."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Cakes?\n* Pies?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well.\n* I sure hope it is nice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/15}* It better not be rationed ice cream."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* SANS's fondness for spot-the-difference puzzles..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Has always been confusing to me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Knowing him, I get the strangest feeling..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* That there is more to it than meets the eye."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Or, eye-socket in his case, I suppose.\n* Hee hee."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Why would someone want to solve a near- impossible puzzle?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* SANS never stops talking about his brother's spaghetti."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* But just imagine the PASTABILITIES..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Rigatoni!\n* Fettuccine!\n* Acini Di Pepe!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Some variety could really help him go FARFALLE."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Go BIGOLI or go home, as they say!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Math is certainly not my favorite subject..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* ...but it does make for a good puzzle!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Umm... most of the time, it does."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* But umm..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Who has time for that, anyway?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* To my knowledge, ALPHYS is the current royal scientist."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* She may never replace the brilliance of sir ROMAN..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* But I am sure her skills are more than up to the task."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* This may surprise you, but I have a certain respect for scientists."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Such analytical minds!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* If I were you, I would steer clear of dubious salesfolk."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* You never know what strings they may pull..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* A lesson I have had to learn the hard way, unfortunately."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* It is fortunate most of Starton is outdoors."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Otherwise, I would not be able to take your calls!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* My, I should think about getting an upgrade."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* With quality this wooden, it is a wonder we can call at all..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* You must have crossed into town by now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* What do you think?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Napstablook often tells of how friendly it is..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I am glad that such an environment could be fostered out there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* SANS says his house is on the south side of town."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Last I checked, there were no \"sides\" to town..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The town I remember was one large square."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Perhaps there was a split at some point?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oh, hello...!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* So you found a spot with good reception, it seems...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* A good can be rather hard to come by out there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* Though, my old device might have something to do with that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It is good to hear from you, though."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Please, keep yourself safe out there, will you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* I have heard the guards there are... ruthless."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Especially the dogs."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Ah, there you are."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I hope that royal guard captain is not giving you trouble."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* An OUTLANDS visitor once said they're obsessed with spears..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Funny.\n* The captain I recall was into sabers."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I wonder if you know who the \"Saber of Justice\" is..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oh no..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Synthbushes!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Oh, those things are HORRID to get stuck in..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* They get you all itchy and scratchy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* But I know you are smart enough to avoid the danger."
msgstr ""

msgid "f_bird"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Things sound oughly silent where you are..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* As if there is something missing..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Something important..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, no matter.\n* My imagination can run wild sometimes..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Nothing like the chirp of a fearsome little bird..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* That bird has always been there for us."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Taking us places..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* I once used its services to carry grocies!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* ...back when we all lived in that cramped factory."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Chirp, chirp, chirp..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Being trapped there is not a memory I like to revisit."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* For all the dark and dingy places in that factory..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* There are pockets of beauty to be found."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Carpe diem, little one.\n* Do not pass up the chance to see them..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I take it you have been in Aerialis for a while now?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Hee hee.\n* Exploration is not such a bad thing!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Just be sure not to turn purple like the rest of the place."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/4}* It is a very serious condition, my child."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* The royal lab is such a great place to learn."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Being the home of so many breakthroughs, it is quite storied."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* If I ever become a teacher, I would host a field trip here!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* With ALPHYS's permission of course."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I wonder if Aerialis is still full of scaffolding..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* They should have finished the project by now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Somehow, I am not filled with confidence."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oh, I had almost forgotten about SANS."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* He is still looking after you, is he not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* That, or he has once again started selling corn dogs."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Why do I get the feeling it is the latter."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Silly skeleton."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* When hearing about your hijinks with METTATON..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I had a thought."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* How could a robot like him exist after our ban on AI programs?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Surely ALPHYS would not break such a well- established rule..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* There must be some other explanation."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* A fountain?\n* I do not remember any fountains out there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Then again, I have been away for a long time..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I am sure I would be very surprised if I came out there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I wonder what other wild things they have built!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Spire houses, perhaps?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Be wary of abandoned side pathways in Aerialis."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* You may find secrets you wish you had not stumbled upon..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* If you enter the rec center, I will not be able to reach you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Past the rec center is the CORE... and the CITADEL."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* This could very well be the last time I hear from you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* Please, young one... be good, won't you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* I am so sorry I cannot be with you on the rest of your journey."

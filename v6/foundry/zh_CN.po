msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/1}* And I'll help them!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asgore1}{#f/6}* Heh, perhaps you can, little one.\n* Perhaps you can."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Since we last met, I have been thinking very hard about everything."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* It is difficult to say it, but...\n* He is too far gone."

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* My son... he will never be whole again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/4}* I'm just gonna let you guys talk about this..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asgore1}{#f/1}* No, no, that is alright. We were just about to end it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Think about my words carefully, human."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* That is all I ask."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/2}* Woah... he's AMAZING!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I've heard stories about the king's speeches, but WOW!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* I wish he was MY dad..."

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* Once upon a time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/10}* And your point is?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asgore1}{#f/12}* Well...\n* What changed?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* What made you into this... stranger... standing here now?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* You REALLY wanna know?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#p/asgore1}{#f/7}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#p/asriel2}{#f/7}* Be honest."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#p/asgore1}{#f/1}* ...\n* Well, no...\n* Not really..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#p/asriel2}{#f/8}* Tch.\n* Now that's more like the Asgore I know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/6}* You'd rather pretend everything's juuuust fine, ain't that right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/7}* Well, guess what, pal.\n* You're overdue for a wakeup call."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/8}* (I'd give you one right now if you weren't a freakin' hologram...)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#p/asgore1}{#f/12}* I heard that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#p/asriel2}{#f/8}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#p/asgore1}{#f/15}* You know... sometimes I wonder how I got here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* No homeworld... no family... trapped here by the humans..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* And now, my kingdom is going to burn and all I can do is watch."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/15}* If you're asking ME for insight, you must be really desperate..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* Small word of advice.\n* Next time, don't get your children killed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asgore1}{#f/2}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* You say that as if...\n* You aren't..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* You know what, Asriel?\n* Forget it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* Because you're right..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Reasoning with you is a total waste of time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/15}* ...wow.\n* I'm impressed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* You finally said something intelligent for once."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/10}* So what now?\n* What's next for the aspiring king?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asgore1}{#f/15}* To be honest?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* I have no idea, Asriel."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/10}* Did I detect a hint of anger at the end?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* I've gotta take care of some things, so I'll leave you two alone."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/3}* Will you be back?\n* You gotta tell me more about Undyne..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/4}* I promised, didn't I?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Don't worry.\n* I'll be back before you know it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/4}* Okay..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* Hey, stop here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* Well, here we are again, $(name)."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* ...look, I know Undyne won't die when the kid hits her."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* From what I can see, though, it's our best way forward for now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* Let's just stick to the script, yeah?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/5}* Howdy, $(name)!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Did you miss me?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* I see you've parted ways with your friend..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* You must be so lonely..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Well.\n* Don't you worry."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I think I may just have the solution."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/5}* Yoo-hoo!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/1}* Aw..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* You'd do anything for me, wouldn't you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/9}* M-hm..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/1}* Well, whaddaya think?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* They weren't easy to get ahold of, you know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* They kept saying they wanted to be forgotten..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* Golly, $(name).\n* What did you do to them while I was gone?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* They wouldn't stop asking me where you were..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* Golly, $(name).\n* What were you two doing while I was gone?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Well y'know... just think of it as a gift.\n* For being so helpful."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/12}* Helpful...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* Well, at least that's outta the way now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* Hey, kid...\n* Can you do me a favor?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/kidd}{#f/9}* ...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/7}* Solve the puzzle."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/10}* Done already?\n* Golly..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* This is the potential monsters deny themselves, $(name)."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* Hope, fear, empathy...\n* They cling to these pointless emotions."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* Under MY guidance, their mind has been unlocked. Untethered."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* A true servant to the spirit of chaos."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/4}* Right on time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* Well done, kid."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/4}* If we keep this up, we'll be over and done with in no time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* It's over, $(name)..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* We've done it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* That IDIOT captain..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* Did she REALLY think she stood a chance?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* Granted, it took us a few runs..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* Granted, it took us an extra run..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* Granted, she did put up a valiant stand..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* But in the end, we both knew what was destined to happen."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* ...if only that victory felt as good as it did the first time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* Oh well."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* Killing Undyne is quickly becoming our hobby."

msgid "<32>* BECAUSE I'M ALREADY TAKEN!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Go find your own dummy and get the hell outta my face!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Hands off the goods!\n* I ain't rated \"E\" for everyone, you know!"

msgid "<32>* Wimpy strikes like yours will never compare to those of Undyne!"

msgid "<32>* You've got quite the intimidating stare."

msgid "<32>* It's a shame you wasted it on me..."

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* It's a ghost bed.\n* You'd sleep right through it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* It's a voicebook."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You pick it up and open to the only recorded section...)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/hapstablook}* Dear diary..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Humans dream of so many fantastical stories, but when I look out my window..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...all I can see is a wall."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Is it right that we monsters have become used to this sad state of living?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Is it right that only the youngest children seem to be truly alive?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Our sense of wonder has been beaten out of us..."

msgid "<32>* Won't somebody do something?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You put the book back down.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I've been binge-watching old human television series."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* These people aren't like what I've been told... in fact, they're a lot like us."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Living, laughing, loving...\n* Hurting and crying.\n* Doing what they believe in."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* To most monsters, humanity is a species that should be feared."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But the more I see of them... the more I grow weary of that sentiment."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And, really, monsters aren't all starlight and roses, either."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Everything has nuance."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's been a hard day at the farm for Blooky and I."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Two of the snails we'd been looking after escaped, and we couldn't find them."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It wouldn't be the first time I failed to do my part here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And I doubt it'd be the last time, either."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I met the new royal scientist recently...\n* Alphys, I think?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Names are hard when you've spent most of the day working tirelessly on a stagnant farm."

msgid "<32>* I never thought I'd meet someone who shares my views on humanity..."

msgid "<32>* But I guess life can surprise you like that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Alphys and I have started work on a new project."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The outpost grows ever drearier by the day, and that has to change."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* We'll be taking inspiration from those imaginative humans..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...by starting a new, public- broadcast television series!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I've already written numerous elaborate scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Haha... let's just say things could get \"explosive.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Oh, how I longed for a day like this to come..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Heh... suffice it to say, this is probably going to be the last diary I record."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I've got a brighter future ahead of me now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* In time, I hope the others come to understand my choice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Because, no matter what happens to me next..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* A little part of me will always miss being here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* Another couch, another awful temptation... you're so tired after all this traveling."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* ...but you have to keep going!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* \"Two star-crossed lovers fall into a digital abyss...\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* An old earth television.\n* An odd, yet fitting choice..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* A beautiful view... of the outside foundry wall."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* I'll be honest..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/14}* It's been a long time since I've seen the bottom of that drawer."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* Nothing but bones..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* It's a drawer reserved just for Papyrus.\n* I like this."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* Humans can be awful, but their history... kinda rules."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Case in point, this giant energy saber!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Historically, humans wielded sabers up to ten times their size."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* Not to mention their inter-dimensional portals..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* Colossal parsec-length battleships..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* When I first heard about it, I immediately wanted my own!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/14}* That's why Alphys and I built a giant replica saber together."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* She even figured out all the specs herself!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You feel this weapon has quite a past.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* I once owned a toy just like this.\n* Except smaller."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* That's my snack closet."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* What, you thought I had a bedroom back there or something?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* Pfft, hah!\n* Everyone knows I sleep on a cold, hard floor."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* I get the feeling there's more to this \"closet\" than snacks."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/11}* Cold food and I don't really get along."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/14}* Luckily, Alphys modded my fridge so it heats up food instead!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Neat, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* There are several pre-heated plates of spaghetti inside."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* A hot fridge would have done wonders back home."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/17}* Steal anything from that drawer, and you're DEAD."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* There's a silverware drawer.\n* It has forks, spoons, knives..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...tiny cosmo-spears, plasma sabers, dimensional axes, anti-grav boomerangs..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* That's my piano."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* It's not the most modern instrument..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* But it's got a certain charm to it, y'know?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* Smells like nerds."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* I once forgot to turn the sink off before heading out to work."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* When I got back home, the house was nearly flooded..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* Not that it was a problem for me!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* Disappointingly, there is no fur stuck in the drain."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* This stove is supposed to be some top-of-the- line MTT thing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* But, as much as technology advances..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Nothing will ever beat food home-cooked with fire magic."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* The stove has seen a lot of heavy use."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/16}* Yeah."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/14}* Papyrus tends to go the \"scenic route.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* Papyrus flew out so fast, it triggered a sonic boom."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* The endless abyss of space is met only by the distant sight of the factory's edge."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* \"Foundry Exit\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* ...so much for the \"kill or be killed\" speech, eh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* ...that was close."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* ..."
msgstr "<32>{#p/narrator}* ..."

msgid "<32>* This won't be easy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Heck, this won't even be intermediate."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But... if I've learned anything thus far..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That won't be a problem for you, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* No matter what Undyne says, I know you'll find a way to get through to her."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* So go on."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Step forward and show her what you're made on."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (It sounds like someone is banging their head against an imaginary wall.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* So.\n* One second, we're running for our lives from her..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And the next?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* We're cooking spaghetti with her.\n* And burning her house down."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You hear a small giggle.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* Oh, uh, sorry!\n* I..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I can't... actually remember the last time I felt this way."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's... good?\n* I mean, things are finally going right for once."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* At least, that's how it feels..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Well.\n* Here's hoping it continues!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* We did it.\n* We really did it!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Or, uh, you did it.\n* I just sorta... watched?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Well, it'll be nice to finally have her off your back."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The rest of the journey should be straightforward now, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Right!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...anyway...\n* Well done, partner."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I don't think anyone's going to replicate THAT stunt again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* Phew..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* No... no!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Don't do this..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* She'll die if she doesn't get the fluid..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You and I, we've come so far... and it can't end now!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Not like this..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Please..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* Please..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* A certain, sudden coldness washes over you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* Wow, look at that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The Citadel..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...that's where we're headed, you know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's where King Asgore lives."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I guess you could say he's the misunderstood type..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...but that's par for the course out here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Whatever happens, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Appreciate what's given to you before it's too late."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You can't regret that...\n* Can you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}SO YOU'RE HERE."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#f/5}UNDYNE... ISN'T READY TO BEFRIEND YOU RIGHT NOW."

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* In fact, my sudden change of mind..."

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* Err... why don't you have a seat?"

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/13}* A book???\n* Does this look like a librarby to you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* The only books you'll find in the kitchen are cookbooks!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* Which I don't use, because cooking is supposed to be an ART."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Why does nobody seem to get that???"

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/12}* It's good, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* Nothing but the best for my ABSOLUTELY SPECIAL FRIEND!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/12}* Hey..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/12}* You know, it's kinda funny you chose THAT drink..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* Water, I mean."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Asgore and I once joked about how humans are made of it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* And that if we drank it, we'd be CONSUMING humanity!!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* ...well, he didn't really find it funny."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* The guy's got a soft spot for just about everyone..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/12}* You know, it's kinda neat you picked out THAT drink..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* Exoberry punch..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Alphys and Papyrus sort of \"invented\" it together."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* I wasn't the biggest fan, but when I showed it to Asgore..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* Well, let's just say he had it put into mass- production."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/12}* You know, it's kinda cool you went with THAT drink..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* Hot cocoa..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* This one time, they had to fix up the atmospheric thingy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* No heat, very little air... it got colder, and colder..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Then, Asgore came over and offered me a hot cocoa."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* We sat together in this very room..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/12}* You know, it's kinda weird you ended up liking THAT tea..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* Starling tea..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* That's always been Asgore's favorite kind."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/14}* Actually, now that I think about it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* You kinda remind me of him."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* You're both total weenies!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* ...sort of."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/16}* Y'know, I was a pretty hotheaded kid."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Once, to prove I was the strongest, I tried to fight Asgore."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* Emphasis on TRIED."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I couldn't land a single blow on him!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* And worse, the whole time, he refused to fight back!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* I was so humiliated..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* Afterwards, he apologized and said something goofy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* \"Excuse me, do you want to know how to beat me?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I said yes, and from then on, he trained me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* One day, during practice, I finally knocked him down."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* I felt... bad."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* But he was beaming..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I had never seen someone more proud to get their butt kicked."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Anyway, long story short, after completing my training..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/14}* I took up leadership of the Royal Guard!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* So I'm the one who gets to train dorks to fight!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* ...like, uh, Papyrus."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* But, um, to be honest..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* ...I don't know if..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* I can ever let Papyrus into the Royal Guard."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* Don't tell him I said that!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* He's just...\n* Well..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* I mean, it's not that he's weak."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* He's actually pretty freaking tough!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* It's just that...\n* He's..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* He's too innocent and nice!!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* I mean, look, he was SUPPOSED to capture you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}* And he ended up being FRIENDS with you instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* I could NEVER send him into battle!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* He'd get ripped into little smiling shreds."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* That's part of why..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* I started teaching him how to cook, you know?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* So, um, maybe he can do something else with his life."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/12}* Oh, sorry, I was talking for so long..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* You're out of water, aren't you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* You're out of punch, aren't you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* You're out of cocoa, aren't you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/12}* You're out of tea, aren't you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/12}* Heh, don't worry.\n* I'll get you some more."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/17}* Wait a second..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* Papyrus...\n* His cooking lesson..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/17}* HE WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW!!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/11}* And if HE's not here to have it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* YOU'LL HAVE TO HAVE IT FOR HIM!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* That's right!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* NOTHING has brought Papyrus and I closer than cooking!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* Which means that if I give you his lesson..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* WE'LL BECOME CLOSER THAN YOU CAN EVER IMAGINE!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* First, let's start with the sauce!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Envision these veggies as your mortal enemy!"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* YEAH!\n* YEAH!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Our minds are uniting against these healthy ingredients!"

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/6}Feisty today, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>Heh, we'll just scrape this into a bowl later."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/6}* Uh, we'll just scrape this into a bowl later."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* But for NOW!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* We add the noodles!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Homemade noodles are the best, so I always keep some around."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/12}* Uhh, you can come over here now, kid."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* Anyway, you see these noodles here, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Well..."

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Well, now it's time to stir the pasta!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You throw everything into the pot as hard as you can, including the box.)"

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/17}* YEAH!!\n* I'M INTO IT!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Alright!\n* Now it's time to stir the pasta!"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You mention how Doge was mistreated, and that Undyne's lack of care is clear."

msgid "<32>* Muffet is interested."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Her ears open, you propose that a deal with the ELITE squad is flimsy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You point out that one of their ranks already failed to capture you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* She begins to carefully think everything over..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But Muffet hasn't said anything to counter yet."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* Muffet is deadset in her goal."

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Muffet pockets the G and bows to you and Monster Kid."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Her subjects will be well fed for quite a while."

msgid "<32>* Muffet doesn't care about fighting anymore."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* You attempt to pay Muffet..."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* You try to pay Muffet again..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* This had a chance of working, if only Muffet trusted you a little more."

msgid "<32>{#p/kidding}* This isn't funny...!"

msgid "<32>{#k/4}* Every few days, some of the kids from school would host these time trial races."

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* The weather wasn't always friendly, but they didn't care.\n* If anything, it just made things more interesting."

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* Don't get me wrong.\n* Thundersnail is fun, but it's just not the same thing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/3}* My family?\n* Eh, there's not much to say.\n* I had good parents, a few siblings."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* One day, king Erogot came to our town.\n* He and I met at one of those races I told ya about."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* I was an insignificant country bumpkin, but he saw somethin' in me, somethin' more..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/4}* One thing led to another, and I ended up moving away from my family at an early age."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* ...that was the last time I'd ever get to see them face to face."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/0}* Erogot, the king of the last great era of our homeworld."

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/2}* If you haven't, then what asteroid have ya been living under for all this time!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* Under his reign, the monster species came so far.\n* Perhaps a little too far."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* He was so happy to meet a human for the first time... but not for himself."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/1}* Nah, that was his son's wish.\n* Poor kid got exactly what he asked for and then some..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/3}* Forgive me, but I don't really wanna talk about that too much more."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/1}* Ol' Fluffybuns wouldn't want you to carry that kinda burden."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/3}* Eh?\n* Fight you?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/1}* Nah... I'm not a hero.\n* Not anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* And b'sides...\n* You may have spared Undyne, but everyone else is still dead."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/4}* I'm better off holding my ground right where I am..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* And b'sides...\n* People seem to go missing after they run into you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/4}* I'll take that as an omen to stay right where I am..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* And b'sides...\n* After what you did to Undyne, I know I don't stand a chance."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* And b'sides...\n* These old bones aren't fit for fighting anyhoo."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/1}* One attack from you, and then I'd... well..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/4}* At least by talking to you, I've bought enough time for some of them to escape."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/3}* You wanna know about the Foundry?\n* This old place?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* Well, it's a place people often get lost..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* Or left behind..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/2}* Boy, I sure hope that doesn't happen to you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* Well, it's never been the friendliest location..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* From the humans sending us here to die, to the recent loss of a fighting spirit..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* Nothin' but bad luck down here, kid."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/2}* Well, back when we first got trapped out here, this WAS the outpost!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* All those fancy-schmancy sections added on afterwards were built by us monsters."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* Turns out most people aren't into the idea of living in the past.\n* Fair enough."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/2}* But... I just think there's something so decadent about repurposing this place."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* It was the humans who trapped us here, hoping we'd rot and suffer in darkness."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* But look at us now.\n* Look at how we've made this place our own."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/2}* Wa ha ha!\n* Talk about showing 'em who's boss, eh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/1}* I take it you've killed her by now?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/1}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* Then why ask me..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* Unless..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/2}* You just wanna get my reaction, don'tcha?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/4}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/4}* How about... nah."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/1}* I get it, guys."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/1}* She's dead."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* You expectin' me to throw a party for you or somethin'?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/1}* Get outta my sight."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/4}* Undyne?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/4}* She passed through here earlier..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/4}* She just passed through here a few moments ago."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* Said she'd \"given up\" on tryin'a capture you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/4}* What happened back there...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/3}* Undyne?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* I haven't heard from her in a while."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/4}* She just kinda... disappeared."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* Was that your doing?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/1}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/1}* You killed her, just like you killed everyone else."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* Granted, she wasn't intent on letting YOU live..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/1}* But don't act like this was just self-defense for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* Wa ha...\n* I know you better than that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/4}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* What more is there to say?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/4}* So are you and her... friends now?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/2}* Wa ha ha!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* You've done something I never thought possible, kiddo!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* Said she was \"done\" tryin'a capture you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/4}* The heck did you do to make her say THAT?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/4}* If you're askin' me where to find her, she's at home.\n* Ain't but a few steps away."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* From her words to me before..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/4}* Seems like you two have some things to work out."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/1}* Something tells me you played a part in that..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* Well... you killed her."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* Though, that's kinda her own doing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/4}* I never really got why she was so intent on killing you humans..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* If she wanted your SOUL, couldn't she just wait until you died naturally?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* Oh well."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/0}* Undyne?\n* Oh, that poor little urchin.\n* Normally, I'd call her the hero..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/1}* But to be honest, I've seen what you've done.\n* She doesn't stand a chance."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/4}* Don't get me wrong, she'll give ya one hell of a fight."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* But no... this world needs a different kinda hero now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* Someone that doesn't operate on brawn and bravado..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* Someone that doesn't see the world like everyone else..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* Wa ha ha.\n* I don't doubt someone like that will be the end of you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/1}* I'm not a hero."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* But I know there's someone out there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Someone who'll never give up trying to do the right thing, no matter what."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* There's no prophecy or legend 'bout anyone like that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's just something I know is true."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* One day, someone like that will strike you down."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/0}* Undyne?\n* Yeah, she's a local hero around here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/4}* Through grit and determination alone, she fought her way to the top of the Royal Guard."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* Actually, she just came through here asking about someone who looked just like you..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/2}* I'd watch your back, kid.\n* And buy some items...\n* It might just save your hide!\n* Wa ha ha!"

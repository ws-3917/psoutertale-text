msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...that's a cryin' shame."

msgid "<32>* That's an ending for the ages!"

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* You did pretty well for someone with no real practice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...beginner's luck, perhaps?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Workin' at the lab is a treat, I tell ya."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Have you ever been inside the virtualasium?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* It's a wonder you even made it here at all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Kinda seems like you weren't."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I'm sure you'll get another chance on the next episode."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* MTT seems to have made you his darling star-child."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Maybe next time you could, I dunno, win more comfortably?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Just a thought."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Or maybe, MTT just went a little easy on ya."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He does seem to have made you his darling star-child."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Yeah, you heard that right.\n* Out of bounds."

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}* That show was amazing!\n* The human almost looked real this time!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Wait, have I seen you before?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}* So the human WAS real...\n* Wow, Mettaton must be REALLY good at networking!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}* Your performance was great, by the way."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}* Mettaton usually has a schedule, but he forgot to make one this time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}* I swear you look like the actor Mettaton brought on..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}* I can't believe I didn't notice you were a human before!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}* I'm a reporter!\n* Today's news story is about metal 'n' magic!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}* Did ya know Mettaton's actually made of it??\n* Huhehehaw!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}* I'm a reporter!\n* Today's news story is about death 'n' destruction!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}* Did ya know I'm likely goin'a die in a few short hours??\n* Huhehehaw!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I was one of the builders of the ORIGINAL fountain here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Y'know.\n* Before Mettaton decided to rebuild the whole thing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Like, who does that? Who'd rebuild it all just to change a single, tiny detail?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Kind of petty if you ask me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Mind you.\n* I'm not the only one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...ever heard of a T. Reynard?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Yeah, he was in charge of the original build project."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Now he just sells moon rocks for a living..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Ironic, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Finally got outta school, I don't know why I still go there anymore..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Luckily, I hear Mettaton's got something exciting planned for his next show."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I can't wait, brah..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Brah... that was crazy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And... kinda weird?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I mean, some of that stuff looked like junk, but that last item..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...whew, what a stunner."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Brah.\n* I'm glad Mettaton's staying around."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* If it weren't for him, I'd have way less excuses to skip class."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I hope he gets interesting contestants this time..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Tell me YOU wouldn't want a life-sized sci-fi doll."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* As a matter of fact, I'm skipping one right now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I hear things can get pretty weird if you go too far out on these repeating rooms."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Time dilation...\n* Spatial instability..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Yeah, don't ask me what that means, that's just what Dr. Alphys says."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Half the stuff she says makes no sense to most of us."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Humans, monsters..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* No matter the species, you'll always have those neurodivergent types."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I love it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Vulkin and I make up the rap group \"The Pyromaniacs.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Our beats? Fantastic.\n* Our flows? Pyroclastic."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* When I hop on stage, I'm bomb- astically elastic, I make the crowd melt like molten plastic."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And Vulkin?\n* He's a one-stop shop for hot mic-drop classics."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Don't worry."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Our measures aren't TOO drastic."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Oh...\n* When the crowd cheers for us, it feels... so nicey."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* So spicey."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Do YOU know my name!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Wait, don't answer that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You...\n* Y-you LOOK like you know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* You SMELL...\n* ...\n* ...like you know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I bet if I touched you, it'd FEEL like you know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* (It'd also be way, WAYYYYYY too hot for you.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But why do you know...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* How... do you know..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* This I will never ever know."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I. Will. Never. Ever. KNOWWWW!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Ah, to be young again.\n* The world sure felt boundless."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* You look young..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Go play!\n* The world isn't so scary."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Go on..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Hubby thinks that because he's old, he can't enjoy life anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But really, he just doesn't like trying new things."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Kids try new things all the time, and look how happy they are!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* If you're ever bored with life, try something new."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It could be a movie, a hobby, or even a language..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Anything is possible!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* What are you waiting for?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Do you wanna play Monsters and Humans!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'll be the human."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I wanna learn how to play smart human games like chess."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Starry's mom over there is the best... she can beat anyone!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* What's a \"zugzwang?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* We came to see Mettaton's grand finale, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I didn't think I'd get to see the human up close!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...you are the human, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Hey, you're the human who outlasted Mettaton on his own show!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* What an incredible performance!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I'll be rooting for Mettaton."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* ...do you do autographs?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Aren't you excited for the grand finale!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The final showdown between Mettaton and his human star..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* One last dramatic stand for humans and monsters alike!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Mettaton really had us there at the end..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* For a moment, I thought he'd be leaving for good!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I'm rooting for the human."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* And then, that moment passed."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* This bear insists on gifting me ornaments to put on my head."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I know it means well, but head ornaments are the last thing I need..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I would much rather visit a simulator."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* ...at least it's not forcing them on me like those teenagers in Starton did."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I feel bad for Gyftrot.\n* It, like many of us, has never lived in its natural habitat."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Alphys has said she's working on a new simulator..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Perhaps when it is complete, we may all find some respite."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}* For now, I will try my best to improve the lives of those less fortunate than I."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* You know why I love hanging out here?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's simple, chief."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* There's no crappy puzzles to figure out here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Yeah, I said it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I said crappy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's just a fact, chief."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Chief."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I'm an art teacher.\n* In art, it's said that there's no right or wrong way."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But one of my students thinks that everything he does is a mistake..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He won't stop apologizing...\n* I want to help him, but I'm at a loss for what to do."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Why is teaching a subjective subject so objectively difficult?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* So listen up, you know my son Stardrake? He isn't feeling too hot."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* So. I ran by the movie theater.\n* A little family movie night never hurts, y'know?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* So I go in, and I see this flick called \"The Great Marinara Heist.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Now one would assume Papyrus, my son's big role model, to star in such a production."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Well. Turns out that's not quite how things ended up. So I went with an alternative."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Well. I played this here move.\n* Pawn to king's knight four?\n* So my opponent walked off."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Now, you see, I have to wait.\n* It'll take a while for that clock to run out, for sure."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* It's called \"Journey to Mole-Rat Outpost.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* So. Is this what humans do?\n* Quit before you lose?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Or is such a tactic unique to monsters?\n* I do wonder."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I heard about yah from my son's friends, they tell me he's been bruised all ovah..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Could yah apologize to him latah for me?\n* It'd mean the world."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I'm a waitah.\n* My wife is a chess playah, and my son is a comedian."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* They say being a waitah is a boring job, but it suits me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Of course, I'm also a fathah.\n* I worry about my son, since he doesn't come home often..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Instead, he tells jokes with his friends in Starton."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* At least the jokes are funny."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...they ARE funny, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Security kicked me out for huffing the wish flowers."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Then the lights went off... I could probably go back in..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The guards have clocked out, so I could go back in..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...but, ahh, this here is the best one I've found so far..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Don't worry about me, I'm just here... huffing a wish flower."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Long ago, they found a weak spot in the force field, about where the Outlands is now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It doesn't mean we can escape through it, but it does mean any human who comes here..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...will have to crash-land right around that area."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* So we built the outpost to be long and winding to slow down a potential invasion."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* We quickly realized it was a dumb idea, but by then, it'd become a tradition."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Now, you can't go two seconds without getting lost..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* At least the CORE wasn't designed with this idea."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Can you imagine how bad it'd be if we had to go through mazes to do maintenance?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Please and no thank you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I work at the CORE.\n* The floor plan is designed to look like a bird."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Oh! I bet you don't know what \"CORE\" stands for!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It stands for \"Charged Onium- ion Refactorization Engine.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* What does it mean?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I have no idea, no idea at all!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Something else that's cool about the CORE is the override switches."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* They're both heavily guarded, but one is guarded by puzzles instead of actual guards!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I sure do love PUZZLE!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* This rec center is an exquisite example of royal design."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* The sky blue faded walls, intercut with gold-laden power lines."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Why power lines, you ask?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Well, apart from the CORE being directly above us..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It gives the area a real sense of purpose."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* We monsters do love our functional fashion."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Is your function fashionable?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* So you're telling me the next comedy show isn't gonna be for another two weeks??"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I thought it was today!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* So you're telling me I can't re-schedule my seat for a later date?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* This place is a total folly!"
msgstr ""

msgid "sans"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Blub blub...\n* (I hope you and your date had a pleasant dining experience.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* (That looked like quite the nice little chat.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Blub blub...\n* (Day by day, the days grow ever lonelier...)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Blub blub...\n* (You'll have to reserve a table to eat here.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* (The girls get ancy when the reservations aren't in order.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Blub blub...\n* (There are no reservations available at this time.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/10}* Why are we going back this way again?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/7}* We really don't need to do this."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/13}* Golly... feels weird to be back where it all started."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/4}* I doubt Alphys meant to bring me back, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Whether I like it or not, she's the reason I'm here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/13}* Funny how things work out, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/13}* Jeez, I forgot how empty this place can be."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* ...at least we've got starlings to keep us company out here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/15}* Starlings are neat little flowers, though."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* They start out small, but once mature..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* The head of the flower comes off and takes to the skies."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Pretty cool, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/13}* Too bad the next blooming period won't be for a while."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* And by then, well..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* It'll be far too late."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* Let me guess, the elevator couldn't take us to the third floor?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* I should have known he'd make us take the long way up."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/8}* One floor down, two floors to go..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/7}* At least we know who caused this now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* It's dark... this isn't normal at all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* Someone must've come through and shorted out the electrics."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* But who...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/10}* Seriously, who turned out the lights?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/15}* Come to think of it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* The burn marks on the emitters look like they were caused by magic."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Alphys DEFINITELY lost her temper coming through here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/10}* No forcefield...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}{#x1}* And look, the emitters are burnt out."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* Golly, what happened to this place?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* I don't know if you saw it, but that note there was telling."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* If Alphys was here earlier, that would explain the lights."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* Wouldn't be the first time she let emotions control her magic."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/4}* Looks abandoned, as you'd expect."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* No doubt Alphys's outburst scared some of them off."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* ...guess there's only one thing to do here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* Let's get to the CORE."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/4}* ...this is still as surreal as ever."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* We'll have to thank Alphys later for the free mood lighting."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* At last..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* The central source of power for the outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* Oh, and, if you haven't figured it out by now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* We're going to blow it to pieces."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* What?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* Stay close. ELITE squad members might be lurking nearby."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* Ready, $(name)?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* You know what we're going to do."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* Ready?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* Let's go."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/10}* No guards...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* $(name)... they really ARE afraid of us."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* Ah... the central control room."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* From here, there's practically a control for everything."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* Gravity plating, heat distribution, even the atmosphere..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* It all runs through this system."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Let's see if my royal access codes are still valid."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* I wouldn't put it past them to forget..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* Here we are."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* Let's give those royal access codes a try."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{*}{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* System, extend the bridge, authorization Asriel $(x).{^40}{%}"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{*}{#f/6}* ...{^40}{%}"

msgid "<25>{*}{#f/7}* I guess no- {%}"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/10}* I guess so."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Say, can you get the back door unlocked while I set this up?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* Pick a side, left or right, and hit the switch at the end."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* You only need to hit one to get through."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* You do your part, and I'll do mine."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/8}* Wrong way, $(name)..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/15}* Perfect timing...\n* Just got done setting up the overload."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/15}* ...\n* If... we're really gonna do this thing..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* ...then it's now or never, $(name)."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* All that's left is to make it to an escape shuttle..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* ...set off the blast..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* ...and ride the shockwave to freedom."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* These idiots won't even know what hit them."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* No..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/1}* Ready?"
msgstr "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/1}* 准备好了？"

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Let's bring about the end of monsterkind."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* Lead us out of here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/8}* Wait, I think I hear something."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* It's Mettaton.\n* He's waiting in the next room."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* I can only make out a silhouette..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* Maybe if we sneak up on him, we can kill him right now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/7}* You know what to do."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/mettaton}* Do you really think I'm going to let you get away that easily?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/8}* ...\n* Don't be coy, Mettaton.\n* Of course you won't."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/7}* It just won't matter when you're dead."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/8}* We've had this chat before, pal."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/mettaton}* Ah..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/mettaton}* But that means I've already killed you once before, doesn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/mettaton}* Heh... don't worry, darling.\n* I'll make your death even quicker this time around."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/2}* Oh, how naive you are."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/1}* It's YOU who's died to us already, and we can make it happen again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/mettaton}* Nice try... but I won't be tricked so easily."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/4}* ...say, since you're about to be spare parts..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Haven't you thought about your family?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* You know.\n* With how you abandoned them, and all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/mettaton}* My family would be proud of me if they knew what I was doing."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* As for you...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I can't exactly say the same."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* I guess it's a good thing I don't care about them, then."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* You, on the other hand, have an emotional weakness..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* With that alone, this battle was over before it even started."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/mettaton}* Listen, darling."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Whatever you have to say, doesn't matter."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* All that matters, is that you're going to lose to me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* For all your talk of victory and inevitability..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* For all the showboating and curbstomping you've done..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* There's one power you failed to consider."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/10}* And what is that?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{*}{#p/mettaton}{#f/1}* The power of NEO.{^40}{%}"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/10}* That's one way to take care of the problem..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/8}* Golly.\n* Why is HE still around."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* The switch is... one-time use.\n* And totally not stuck."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/narrator}* The puzzle has been solved."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#x1}* My boyfriend and I were looking for an ice cream stand for so long...{#x3}"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#x1}* Eventually, we just gave up and settled for pizza.{#x3}"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#x1}* Then we took up guard duty at this security post since we have nothing better to do.{#x3}"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#x1}* I've been told security guards get SUPER exclusive discounts at the shop.{#x3}"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#x2}* I wonder why Alphys had to escort you...{#x3}"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#x2}* You must be... MEGA important.{#x3}"

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* lemme tell you a story."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* so, i'm a royal sentry, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* my job is to sit out there and watch for humans."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* though, i'm sure you've realized by now..."

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* ...i actually took the job so i could protect you guys instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* shh, don't tell undyne i said that.\n* she wouldn't like it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* kinda ironic, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* anyway, i've got this super boring job, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* fortunately, there's a little place near the edge of starton."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* and at the end of the bridge to this place lies a big ol' door."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* now this door was PERFECT for practicing knock knock jokes."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* one day, i'm knockin' em out like usual..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* and i knock on the door and say \"knock knock.\"\n* like usual."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* but then, from the other side..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* i hear a woman's voice."

msgid "<25>{#p/soriel}* \"Who is there?\""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/4}* \"water you doing all the way out here?\""

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* like it's the first joke she's heard in a hundred years."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* so i open the door, introduce myself, and i tell her some more."

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* after about a half dozen or so, SHE knocks and says..."

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* the next day, though..."

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* look at that, you even brought a drink."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}* now we're talking."

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* anyway, like i was saying..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* this woman was under a lot of stress."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* so i asked her..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* \"wanna know what a skeleton does to pass the time?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/soriel}* \"What do they do?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* i then proceeded to play a tune on my trombone."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* her being her, she INSTANTLY got the joke."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* ...that night ended up being the best night we'd ever have."

msgid "<25>{#g/alphysWelp}* Probably a smart choice."

msgid "<25>{#g/alphysCutscene3}* The puzzles here are... uh, simple if you know what you're doing."

msgid "<25>{#g/alphysCutscene2}* To summarize, though, it's really just a... big c-combination lock."

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysCutscene2}* That's one puzzle down."

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysCutscene3}* Come on!"

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>* You are seriously testing my patience right now."

msgid "<25>{#g/alphysCutscene3}* Can you... maybe not kill anyone else?\n* If possible?"

msgid "<25>* This could be bad."

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You hear a small sigh.)"

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysInquisitive}* Unless, of course, you're gonna take the other path...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysSideSad}* Hit the switch in the next room, and we'll be outta this place."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysCutscene1}* You made it!\n* Now hit the switch in the next room!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysCutscene2}* Okay, y-you should be able to continue forward now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysWelp}* Oh, you came back."

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysCutscene3}* You could have reached the capital by now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysGarbo}* Okay, so you've hit both switches."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysGarboCenter}* Happy now?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysWelp}* W-wait, there's a guard ahead."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysNeutralSweat}* Let me see if I can clear the way this time..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (Yet again, the obligatory typing sounds resume.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (And yet again, they stop.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysWorried}* No... they're not on the intercom system..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#g/alphysWelp}* They don't even seem to be part of the staff."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#g/alphysUhButHeresTheDeal}* Well, this is bad!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysNeutralSweat}* Is... is that it?\n* Are we clear?"

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* But hey, who has time for THAT when you've got people like GLYDE hanging around, huh!?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/6}* Haha... let me tell you about this showboating know-it-all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* Back when I worked for Mettaton, I regularly had to make this thing called a \"face steak.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/1}* For the record, that's a steak with Mettaton's \"fabulous\" face on it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* But Glyde?\n* Glyde loved it so much it decided to make its own \"steak empire\" by putting ITS face on steaks instead!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/3}* And as if that wasn't crazy enough, Glyde BID on me to be its first employee!\n* Like I'm up for auction or something!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/4}* Of course, Mettaton wasn't going to let me go that easily, so I ended up staying here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/0}* Long story short, Glyde never got what it wanted, and now it just goes about making threats and demands, hoping people will join its \"crusade.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/1}* I don't know if Glyde ever managed to rope anyone in, but if so, I wish those poor saps the best of luck."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/7}* With a maniac like Glyde in charge, they'll NEED it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/4}* I've told you all I really know about Glyde."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/7}* Maybe there's something buried somewhere in its past to explain why it acts this way..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#k/1}* God knows what that is."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/5}* My future, huh?\n* I dunno, little bully..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#k/6}* You tell me."

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That's something, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* He always orders the worst item off the menu, and he never pays his "

msgstr ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* 嗯...\n"

msgid "<32>* And while monster food converts to energy instantly..."
msgstr ""
"<32>* 而且不像怪物的食物一样\n"
"  可以直接转化为能量..."

msgid "<32>* Human food has to pass all the way through their bodies first."
msgstr ""
"<32>* 人类的食物必须\n"

msgid "<32>* Which it somehow does, even on low gravity."
msgstr ""
"<32>* 就算在低重力的环境\n"

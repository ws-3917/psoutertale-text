msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Are you ready for my \"explosive\" return???"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* You kinda scared everyone off, but some of us came back after what you"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Can't say I blame the ones who didn't, but hey..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I figured I'd give your choice to do the right thing some impact."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* It was bad enough not knowing what kinda species I "
"was on the old homeworld..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* And now, on the new one, there'll be a whole load of new species I "
"don't know."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I might just have to live with the fact that I'll be a bomb... "
"forever..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Talk about emotional fallout."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Wow.\n"
"* Talk about explosive."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That grand finale really had us all shaken!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Literally.\n"
"* It shook this entire area of the outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Well this place sure is the bomb, huh???"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Psst, listen up kid...\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'm... not really a bomb."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Hey, don't be shell-shocked.\n"
"* It's just that people call me a bomb so much..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... that I've just accepted it at this point."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I mean, come on, why does everyone have to live on "
"such a short fuse?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* If a little bullying is all it takes to set you off, then you might as"
" well explode!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But that's just me."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I mean, at this point, if I WERE to find out what "
"kinda plant I really am..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... the realization of such a long-withheld fact would be..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... explosive."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Maybe, if I was actually a bomb, I'd be envious of "
"it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But I'm not, so... I'm not."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'm mostly just pissed off about it, really."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Turns out I'm supposed to look like a rare homeworld"
" plant."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* That old-timer who came by to talk to Burgie last week said it in "
"passing, I think."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... oh, what I'd give to understand what I really am..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* ... still don't blame 'em, though."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* ... it's better to stick to what you know."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* ... you're lucky I don't explode on you right now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* ... don't you ever wonder what you really are?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* So we're free now, huh?\n"
"* What crazy times we must be living in."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Without my job at the Royal Lab, I'll have to find work elsewhere..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* ... or, we could just establish a new Royal Lab on the homeworld."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Normally, I do astronomical research at the Royal "
"Lab."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I was planning on returning to work after today..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But, after what happened to Mettaton, I'm not so sure."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Earlier, though, Alphys told us we can take the day off."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I wonder why..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Imagine how much better it'll be to stargaze with "
"solid ground to roast on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Maybe, somewhere out there, his heart still lives on"
" in those constellations..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Being an astronomer can be fun, but it never hurts "
"to stargaze with your own eyes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Yeah, sometimes I wonder how a person like ya can "
"exist."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Ya saved us in the end, but what's it worth if we're all scared to "
"leave our homes?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I'm not judgin' ya or anything, but ya DO see the irony in that, "
"right?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Our virtualasium project never got off the ground, "
"but maybe..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... that's just a sign of things to come?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* After all, on a new homeworld, it won't have to leave the ground."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* What a tragedy, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* ... it's a good thing most people don't know what ya look like up "
"close."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Ya heard me.\n"
"* Quit while ya're ahead."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* So, ya go by \"$(moniker2)\" now, huh kid?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... that's pretty cool."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Boy, ya really missed the mark on that one, huh kid?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... that's a cryin' shame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Kid, I got one question for ya, and one question "
"only."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... were ya even trying?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Hey, don't feel bad.\n"
"* Ya gave it ya best shot."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... still sucks that ya didn't make it to the end, though."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Gee, talk about cuttin' it close, huh kid?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That's an ending for the ages!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Ya did pretty well for someone with no real "
"practice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... beginner's luck, perhaps?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Workin' at the lab is a treat, I tell ya."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Have ya ever been inside the virtualasium?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Wonderful place.\n"
"* Though they say ya shouldn't go out of bounds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Why don't ya go find someone else to bully, eh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I only hope we can expand our userbase past that one"
" eccentric skeleton fellow."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* If they did, ya'd be in some deep doo-doo by now."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Or don't.\n"
"* Just don't make me say I told ya so, ya got me?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* It's not like I had a moniker at ya age or anything."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* It's a wonder ya even made it here at all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Kinda seems like ya weren't."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Ya might get another chance on the next episode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Maybe next time ya could, I dunno, win more "
"comfortably?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Or maybe MTT just went a little easy on ya."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Yeah, ya heard that right.\n"
"* Out of bounds."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Now what the heck is that supposed to mean?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Don't worry about me, school went well today."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'm just really looking forward to MTT's next show!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Do you know when it'll be on?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* That show was amazing!\n"
"* The human almost looked real this time!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Wait, have I seen you before?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Ack, what a letdown.\n"
"* To think he'd cancel his big show just like that..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Did you... do that?\n"
"* Did you kill Mettaton for real?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* No... it has to be fake.\n"
"* Mettaton's just too popular to die!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* So the human WAS real...\n"
"* Wow, Mettaton must be REALLY good at networking!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Your performance was great, by the way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Mettaton usually has a schedule, but he forgot to make one "
"this time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I swear you look like the actor Mettaton brought on..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* Oh well, maybe next time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}* I can't believe I almost fell for it!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I can't believe I didn't notice you were a human before!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I'm a reporter!\n"
"* Today's news story is one I really don't want to report!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I'm gonna lose my marbles!!\n"
"* Huhehehaw!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I'm a reporter!\n"
"* Today's news story is about death 'n' destruction!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Did ya know someone's been killed right in front of me??\n"
"* Huhehehaw!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* I'm a reporter!\n"
"* Today's news story is about metal 'n' magic!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Did ya know Mettaton's actually made of it??\n"
"* Huhehehaw!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Did ya know I'm likely goin'a die in a few short hours??\n"
"* Huhehehaw!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}* Oh dear!\n"
"* I really do love my job!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Who, me?\n"
"* Someone who'd evacuate?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Never.\n"
"* I only went with them because they said I had to."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I get that you were some kinda bully or something..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... but it's not as if you were going to kill me."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Everyone else around here's been invited to that "
"hangout."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* But me?\n"
"* I'm not even interested."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Sure, I'm glad you went and saved us and all..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* ... but that doesn't mean I have to stand around and indulge in the "
"Madrigal plant."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Poor, poor Mettaton, whatever will you do."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Oh, that's right.\n"
"* Nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* For once, Mettaton did the right thing, and "
"cancelled a show."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That grand finale wouldn't have ended well for him."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Why?\n"
"* Just a feeling."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I was one of the builders of the ORIGINAL fountain "
"here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Y'know.\n"
"* Before Mettaton decided to rebuild the whole thing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Like, who does that? Who'd rebuild it all just to change a single, "
"tiny detail?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Kind of petty if you ask me."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I can't BELIEVE Mettaton's running his TV shows when"
" there's a killer on the loose."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Does he not see how dangerous that could be?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Someone's going to end up getting killed doing that nonsense."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Kind of idiotic if you ask me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Like, really, people?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Did you seriously think I'd want to run away like that?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Come on.\n"
"* I'm not THAT soft."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... ugh, never mind."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Mind you.\n"
"* I've never been one for parties."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* My main hobbies and interests consist primarily..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... of pointing out and picking apart poor imitations."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Like this fountain."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* As far as I'm concerned, this is all his fault."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He got too over-confident, and he paid the price."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Too bad, so sad, be glad I'm not your dad."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* The more he stays out of our lives, the better."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'd ask him never to show up again, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... then I wouldn't have anything to be upset about."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Mind you.\n"
"* I'm not the only one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Ever heard of a \"Mr. Sepluv?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Yeah, he was in charge of the original build project here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* But now... he sells moon rocks for a living."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Mind you.\n"
"* I'm standing out here, too."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* So I guess I'm just as guilty."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Embarrassing, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Pointless, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Ironic, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Finally got outta school, I don't know why I still "
"go there anymore..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Luckily, I hear Mettaton's got something exciting planned for his next"
" show."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I can't wait, brah..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Brah... that was crazy."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And... kinda weird?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I mean, some of that stuff looked like junk, but that last item..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ... hot diggity damn!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I'm ruined, brah...\n"
"* Mettaton just uppin' cancelled his latest show."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Now what excuses will I have to skip class...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Brah.\n"
"* I'm feeling pretty hurt about Mettaton's death."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* I'll have an excuse to skip classes for a little while, but after "
"that, I'm ruined!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Brah.\n"
"* I'm glad Mettaton's staying around."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* If it weren't for him, I'd have way less excuses to skip class."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* I hope he gets interesting contestants this time..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Tell me YOU wouldn't want a life-sized sci-fi anime "
"doll."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* It's a cryin' shame, brah."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Real inconsiderate, Mettaton.\n"
"* Real inconsiderate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* As a matter of fact, I'm skipping one right now..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* They say things can get pretty weird if you go too "
"far out in these repeating rooms."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Time tunnels...\n"
"* Invariant spatial flexures..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Eh, don't ask me what any of that means, I just overheard Alphys one "
"time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* If it wasn't her saying it, I'd probably just think it was made up..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* As long as you can still see clearly, you're "
"probably fine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* You've been a bully in the past, but you might've "
"redeemed yourself..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* We just came back to ask, were you really being yourself?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* Not everybody likes you, and some are still afraid..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* But I guess that's how it goes when you've got violence in your veins."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* When we get to the new homeworld, we're comin' out "
"straightforward."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* With bars and rhymes so toward they'll beat other writers to their "
"foreword."
msgstr ""

msgid "<33>* For anyone who challenges us, we've got but four words..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* This is our world."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Vulkin and I make up the rap group \"The "
"Pyromaniacs.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* Our beats? Fantastic.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<33>* When I hop on stage, I'm bomb- astically elastic, I make the crowd "
"melt like molten plastic."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>* And with Vulkin?\n"
"* It's a one-stop shop for hot mic-drop classics."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Don't worry."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* We can forgive your brutish ways."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Our flows are ALL above board."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Our measures aren't TOO drastic."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* A new home means new crowds..."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Oh...\n"

msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* So nicey."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<32>{#p/basic}{#npc/a}* Those guards who evacuated me disrespected my "

msgid ""
"<32>* Without that, you will lose yourself behind a mask of your own making "

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid ""

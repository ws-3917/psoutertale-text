msgid ""
">{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}... WHEN I SAW THE LACK OF A TACKY BILLBOARD NEARBY."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/undyne}{#f/17}* So do you LIKE using elevators or NOT?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/6}WELL..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}I LIKE THE MUSIC, BUT HAVING TO USE THEM IS A PAIN."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* Well, just be glad you don't live in a spire house, "

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}HOW COME?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/undyne}{#f/17}* Elevators EVERYWHERE."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/6}N-NO...!"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/undyne}{#f/8}* AND THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE MUSIC!!!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/1}IT'S UNFATHOMABLE!"

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/9}LIFTGATES!!!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}AN ELEVATOR WITHOUT MUSIC IS LIKE..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}A PLATE OF SPAGHETTI WITHOUT MARINARA SAUCE."

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}OR ALFREDO SAUCE, IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE MY BROTHER."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}WHAT HAPPENS TO A SKELETON WHO WALKS THROUGH SECURITY?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}... OH YEAH.\n"
"HE GETS ELECTROCUTED."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/6}JUST LIKE I WAS, THE FIRST TIME I CAME HERE!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* Sounds like quite the story you've got there."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}OH, IT WAS QUITE A STORY, ALRIGHT..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}JUST NOT A VERY GOOD ONE."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/undyne}{#f/14}* Could it be summed up as \"I had no idea what I was "

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/7}HEY, I -ALWAYS- KNOW WHAT I'M DOING!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}IT'S MORE OF AN \"I WAS POWERLESS TO STOP IT\" SCENARIO."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/undyne}{#f/17}* Wait, if you were electrocuted by the security "

msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}ACTUALLY, THAT'S A GOOD POINT..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/6}IT'S A LONG STORY."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}PERHAPS IT'S NOT SUCH A BAD STORY AFTER ALL."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}MY BROTHER ONCE HOSTED A COMEDY SHOW HERE."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}IT WAS CALLED..."

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}... THE RIB-TICKLER."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}DESPITE THE TITLE, IT WASN'T A COMPLETE FAILURE."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}IN FACT, IT DID PRETTY WELL!!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* To be honest, I'm kind of surprised he stopped doing "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/undyne}{#f/16}* But I guess he just really wanted to be a sentry or "

"THAT MUST BE IT."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/9}MAYBE YOU JUST DIDN'T ADD ENOUGH MARINARA SAUCE!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}I WOULD'VE JUST DONE IT MYSELF..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}THE SIGNAL SEEMS TO BE A BIT WEAK."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/6}IT'S LIKE... INTERFERENCE OF SOME KIND??"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}MAYBE IT'D BE A GOOD IDEA TO CALL BACK ELSEWHERE."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/undyne}{#f/14}* They're probably near the old security tower in "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/undyne}{#f/17}* There's something about the kind of metal they used to"

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}DID MY MESSAGE NOT GET THROUGH THE FIRST TIME?"

msgid ""
">{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}... WHEN I SAW THE LACK OF A TACKY BILLBOARD NEARBY."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/undyne}{#f/17}* So do you LIKE using elevators or NOT?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/6}WELL..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}I LIKE THE MUSIC, BUT HAVING TO USE THEM IS A PAIN."

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}HOW COME?"

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}... OH WAIT, THERE TOTALLY IS!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/9}LIFTGATES!!!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}AN ELEVATOR WITHOUT MUSIC IS LIKE..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}A PLATE OF SPAGHETTI WITHOUT MARINARA SAUCE."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}WHAT HAPPENS TO A SKELETON WHO WALKS THROUGH SECURITY?"

">{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}... OH YEAH.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/6}JUST LIKE I WAS, THE FIRST TIME I CAME HERE!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* Sounds like quite the story you've got there."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}OH, IT WAS QUITE A STORY, ALRIGHT..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}JUST NOT A VERY GOOD ONE."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/undyne}{#f/14}* Could it be summed up as \"I had no idea what I was "

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/7}HEY, I -ALWAYS- KNOW WHAT I'M DOING!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}IT'S MORE OF AN \"I WAS POWERLESS TO STOP IT\" SCENARIO."

msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgid ">{#p/papyrus}{#f/6}IT'S A LONG STORY."

msgid ""
">{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* To be honest, I'm kind of surprised he stopped doing "

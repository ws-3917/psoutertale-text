">{#k/2}* Well, back when we first got trapped out here, this WAS the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#k/2}* But... I just think there's something so decadent about repurposing"

msgid ">{#k/3}* The words strong enough to do it justice don't exist."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/0}* I think, sometime in your future, if you really wanted it..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/0}* You could lead the monster race yourself, as ruler."
msgstr ""

">{#k/2}* Everyone would follow you.\n"

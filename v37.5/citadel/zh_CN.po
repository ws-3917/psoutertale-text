">{#p/asriel2}{#f/15}* But, more than that... I couldn't seem to feel love, "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/23}* I was so afraid... I just wanted everything to go back to normal."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* I went to see Dad, hoping he'd be able to help me."

">{#f/17}* He promised me he'd take care of me for as long as it'd take..."

msgid ""
">{#p/asriel2}{#f/13}* As I was saying, after waking up as a star, I wasn't "

msgid ">{#f/16}* I went to see Mom."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* Then, I went to see Mom."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* Surely, she'd know what to do, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/17}* She'd done so much for me in the past, so..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/23}* If someone, anyone could help me... it'd be her."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/16}* I tried talking to my parents, but they couldn't help me at all."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* ... but it didn't work."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* Realizing that I'd be like this forever..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* Realizing there was nothing I could do to help myself..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/23}* I just wanted it to end."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/15}* I was... ready, for everything to end."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/16}* ... then...\n"
"* Just as I committed to the moment..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}* Just as it all flashed before my eyes..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}* I suddenly found myself back where I started."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/10}* Where were we again?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/6}* ... oh yeah.\n"
"* So I was right back where I started."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/13}* At first, I didn't know how I got there..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/15}* ... so, I tried bringing myself back on purpose."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/16}* I focused my mind on going back again, and... it worked."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/15}* Somehow, I'd gained the power to turn back time."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/17}* And that's when it struck me..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/23}* I'd use my new power to be a force for good."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/15}* I thought, maybe, if I couldn't help myself..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/16}* At least I could help someone else."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/16}* ... oh yeah.\n"
"* So I started out by helping them."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/23}* I'll admit, I struggled at first..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/15}* ... but the more I did it, the better I got."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* After a while, I could even do it with my eyes closed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/9}* Heck.\n"
"* Sometimes I did."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* And, sure, maybe I was a bit of a show-off..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}* But what did it matter?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* After all, I was still helping them..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/15}* ... saving them..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/15}* Being a good person, and all."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/asriel2}{#f/15}* Like I said before, I started out by helping them."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* Soon, though, I began to notice something."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/15}* The same responses, the same outcomes..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/16}* Just being nice all the time wasn't satisfying me anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}* And, yes, before you ask, I did try getting cutesy."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}* But even that became boring in the end."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/10}* I could've gone on, but what would've been the point?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}* It was time to try something else."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* Like I said before, I decided I'd stop being nice all "
"the time."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/4}* Now, it didn't amount to much at first..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* Just a few mean words here and there."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/10}* A part of me felt bad, but what did I really have to lose?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/6}* Of course, once things began to repeat again, I got a little "
"meaner."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/8}* Another insult here, another mockery there..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}* Eventually, I stopped feeling bad about it entirely."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}* It's not like I was killing them or anything."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/asriel2}{#f/4}* Like I said before, I'd gotten used to being mean."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/asriel2}{#f/15}* Then, I thought to myself... if I attacked them..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/16}* It'd be fine, as long as they didn't die."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/10}* What'd be the harm?\n"
"* Monsters can heal, can't they?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/4}* If worst came to worst, I could just RESET, and it'd still be fine."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* ... little did I know how I'd react if it actually happened."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* Like I said before, I'd gotten the idea to attack them."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/13}* I guess you could say I got carried away..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/15}* Pulled... just a little too tightly..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/16}* ..."
msgstr ">{#f/16}* ..."

msgid ">{#f/6}* My own mother, strangled to death by my own magic..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/8}* Begging me to stop as the life drained out of her body."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}* Even after a RESET, the image wouldn't leave my mind."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* I panicked, and tried making up for it by being nice to her."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/15}* But I couldn't forget about what I'd done."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/15}* I just... couldn't look at her... at anyone... the same way again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/asriel2}{#f/15}* Like I said before, I couldn't forget about what I'd "
"done."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/16}* And, after that, things only got worse."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* After that, things only got worse."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/15}* I guess, after screwing up once, it got easier to do it again."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/15}* And soon, be it out of frustration, or raw curiosity..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/16}* What began as an accident spiraled out of control."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/7}* But, hey, when it came down to it, I could always RESET, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/6}* And once I told myself THAT... there really was no going back."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* With each new RESET, my actions became more and more "
"twisted."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}* I subjected them... all of them... to horrors beyond compare."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/15}* I did it again, and again, and again..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/16}* I did it so many times, I'd become completely numb to it."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* Then, finally, after all of that..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* ... nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/3}* I felt nothing.\n"
"* It meant nothing.\n"
"* It was all for nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/15}* As I stood alone in my empty world, I knew what had to be done."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/23}* So I RESET, and let time move forward without me."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* Like I said before, I knew it was all for nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/17}* Don't you see, $(name)?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/23}* This is why I was so excited to be with you after all this time."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* With you by my side, I won't have to do it alone anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/15}* With you by my side... it'll finally mean something for once."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/16}* Besides, this is what you've always wanted, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* To \"set them free?\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/23}* ... heh.\n"
"* We really do make the perfect team."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/17}* Just remember, $(name)."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/17}* As long we stick together, nothing can stand in our way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* ... here.\n"
"* Take my hand."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* Don't worry, I'll hold the cup for you..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/asriel2}{#f/17}* We might as well do it while we still have the chance,"
" right?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/23}* Walking hand-in-hand, past the city, like we always wanted to..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/16}* ... and THEN we'll blow it to pieces."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* Well, that was nice."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* But the outpost's time has come."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/7}* Listen, $(name).\n"
"* These monsters just don't understand us."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}* They'd like to pretend that the universe is a perfect place."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/8}* They'd like to think that anyone can be redeemed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/6}* But you and I?\n"
"* We don't fit within their world view."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}* We're irredeemable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/9}* Heh.\n"
"* Isn't it funny?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* The one thing that keeps us from relating to anyone else..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/16}* ... is precisely what binds us together."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/17}* Listen, once we hitch a ride and escape this place..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/17}* We'll be together forever, $(name)."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/23}* It's our destiny."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* But you know what we have to do now."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/17}* Come on, let's get back to where we were..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/17}* Lead the way."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* ... I'm not going to repeat myself."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* You know why we're here."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/8}* ... finally."
msgstr ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/8}* ...总算解决她了。"

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/8}* Looks like they've already been evacuated..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}* ... hmph."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}* If he thinks that'll stop us, then he's just plain stupid."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/10}* I mean, he could've used their power to destroy us..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/16}* ... but let's be honest."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* He's just not that kind of person, is he?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* Just a moment."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* Meltdown in progress."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* All we need now is a special shuttle..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/9}* One that'll link with our SOULs to let us get past the force field."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* This way."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/5}* Gorey!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* How ya doing?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asgore}{#f/5}* About as good as can be expected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* We've got you cornered, by the way.\n"
"* So no tricks."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asgore}{#f/1}* I have no intention of tricking you, Asriel."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asgore}{#f/2}* I know the end is near."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/asriel2}{#f/10}* Any last words before everything you know is turned to"

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/15}* No?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}* Okay."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}* I guess we'll be on our way, then."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/8}* ... right after I take your access card."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel2}{#f/1}* Come on, $(name)."

msgid ">{*}{#p/twinkly}{#f/19}{#e/twinkly/15}... so..."

msgid ">{*}{#e/twinkly/15}Get up to anything lately?"

msgstr ""

msgid ">{*}{#e/twinkly/17}Personally, I used to make friends ALL the time."

msgid ""
">{*}{#e/twinkly/15}He won't remember this, but I once trained him to be a "

msgid ">{*}{#e/twinkly/18}In fact, I made him get promoted to captain!"

msgid ">{*}{#e/twinkly/24}Granted... it wasn't easy."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{*}{#e/twinkly/15}I miiiight've had to break his bones a few times."

msgid ""
">{*}{#e/twinkly/17}Funny how people change if you push the right buttons, "

">{*}{#e/twinkly/15}Anyway.\n"

">{*}{#e/twinkly/15}It's actually been pretty hard, even for me, to get into."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{*}{#e/twinkly/20}Suffocating everyone to death usually did the trick..."

msgid ""
">{*}{#e/twinkly/15}Anyway, all I'm saying is that the room's protected."

msgid ""
">{#p/sans}{#f/0}* i wonder if that \"ice dream\" guy would mind selling this"

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* it'd certainly get him the customers he's been lacking."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* it'd certainly get him a few new customers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/sans}{#f/0}* ah... nothing like a good scoop of salmon- flavored ice "

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* now for the cone."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/sans}{#f/3}* it's amazing what replication technology can do these "

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* in the past, you'd be lucky to get something edible..."

"* what's that?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* this wasn't in gerson's human combat handbook."

msgid ">{#f/0}* normally i'd say something here, like..."

msgid ">{#f/4}* not being perfect, but still doing the right thing?"

msgid ""
">{#f/2}* lv1's OBVIOUSLY the lowest you can go.\n"

msgid ""
">{#f/2}* it's not as if you can lose any LOVE.\n"
"* that'd be silly."

msgid ">{#f/0}* when you had the chance to save someone's life..."

msgid ">{#f/3}* but a lot of other people feel that way, too."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* just something to keep in mind."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* even if you never killed them, you threatened their lives."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/3}* was it justified?\n"
"* or was it just out of self-defense?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* i guess that's something only you can know."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* then, you flirted with them as if to have your way with them."

msgid ">* i know you have it in you to do what's right when it matters most."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* be good, alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* ... and try not to stand behind any more pillars."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/darksans}* Now, you understand."

msgid ">* It's time to begin your judgment."

msgid ">* Look inside yourself."

msgid ">* Take a moment to think about this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* truthfully, it doesn't really matter which conclusion you came to."

msgid ">* all that's important is that you were honest with yourself."

msgid ">{#f/2}* ... just as soon as i move you back behind that pillar."

msgid ">{#p/sans}{#f/3}* though..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* one thing about you always struck me as kinda odd."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* now, i understand acting in self-defense."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* you were thrown into those situations against your will."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* sometimes..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* you act like you know what's gonna happen."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* like you've already experienced it all before."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* this is an odd thing to say, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* if you have some sort of {@fill=#ff0}special power{@fill=#fff}..."

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* i won't judge you for it."

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* you probably weren't even aware of what you were doing..."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/4}* who gets to lv2 on accident?\n"
"* get outta here."

msgid ">{#f/0}* i'll give you a pass."

msgid ""
">{#p/sans}* lv4...\n"
"* huh."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/4}* i mean, what can i say?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* if it were any higher, i'd think you'd killed people on purpose."

msgid ">{#f/3}* but i guess i'll give you a pass."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* just this once."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/sans}{#f/4}* lv5?"

msgid ">{#f/4}* believe me, i wanna give you the benefit of the doubt..."

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/sans}{#f/4}* lv6?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* humans often say six is a scary number."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/4}* now, i don't claim to be superstitious..."

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* well gee, i dunno about you, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* i doubt much luck was involved in how you got to this point."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... just saying."

msgstr ""

msgid ">* don't humans use this number to predict the future or something?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/3}* that'd be a pretty good explanation for how you've been acting."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/sans}{#f/3}* ... lv9."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* that's pretty bad."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* but hey, look on the bright side..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* ... at least you're still in single-digits."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/sans}{#f/3}* ... lv10."

">{#p/sans}{#f/4}* huh?\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ok then, consider our session over."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* wait a second."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/4}* that look on your face while i was talking..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* you've already heard my spiel, haven't you?"

msgid ""
">{#f/3}* you act like you know what's going to happen in advance sometimes."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* like you've seen certain things before."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* so... hey."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* i've got a request for you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/2}* i kind of have a {@fill=#ff0}secret codephrase{@fill=#fff} that "

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* they'd have to be a time traveler."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* crazy, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* anyway, here it is..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/human}* (Sans whispered something to you.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/sans}{#f/0}* i'm counting on you to come back here and tell me that."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/4}* huh?\n"
"* do you have something to say to me?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/human}* (You told Sans the secret codephrase.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/sans}{#f/2}* what? a codephrase?\n"
"* can you speak a little louder?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/human}* (You told Sans the secret codephrase, but louder.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/sans}{#f/0}* did you..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/4}* ... just say to \"reverse the polarity of the neutron flow?\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/2}* wow.\n"
"* i can't believe you would say that."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/4}* not only is that complete nonsense..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* it's also my secret codephrase."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* so... you really are a time traveler, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/3}* well, alright.\n"
"* i guess that means you're qualified."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* here's the key to my room."

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* ... wait.\n"
"* have you heard this before, too?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* wow, you really ARE a time traveler."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* guess there's not much else to say, then."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#s/equip}{#p/human}* (The Skeleton Key was added to your keyring.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* ... apart from \"i'll move you back behind the pillar now.\""

msgid ">{#f/0}* i mean, i can't even see your face."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* maybe that's for the best."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* but i do know that for you to have done all this..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* you had to have cared about us at some point, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* ... i guess there's every chance that's not true."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/sans}{#f/3}* i know. the whole \"appeal to emotion\" isn't really my "

msgid ">* when someone goes as far as you have..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* intimidation just doesn't seem appropriate anymore."

">{#f/3}* now.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ">* so be it."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* kindness isn't exactly your thing, and i get that."

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* About them not being the kind of friend I wish I had..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* ... but it doesn't mean I wanted them gone!"

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* If they wanted to, they could stay with us.\n* I'd like them to."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* But I'd understand if they wanted to go."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/16}* They \"won\" their game.\n* They shouldn't want to \"play\" with me anymore."

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/23}* Ha..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/22}* I probably seem like a crazy person right now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* Obsessing over someone I should have moved on from already..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/17}* ... I guess $(name) and I really are just a \n  pair of stubborn idiots."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* One time, $(name) and I were fighting over a bed..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* 'Cause, both of us wanted the one with the nightstand next to it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/15}* We were both pushing each other off the side, trying to make room..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* All that fighting got us so tired, that we fell asleep."

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* \"... warm...\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* \"... fluffy...\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/20}* I would have complained about it, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* ... at that point, I was just happy we weren't fighting."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* This other time, $(name) and I were making dinner for Mom and Dad."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/15}* They kept wanting to make it more spicy..."

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* If you ever decide to leave Starton, well..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* My cell phone is old, and cannot reach many areas of the factory."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* You would be without me for a while..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* So please, take care of yourself, alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The Starton puzzles..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* They are surely altered now, but I never liked their original design."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* There were no written instructions anywhere!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* You are near the end of the factory, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Take heart.\n* There are brighter pastures up ahead."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Not to mention..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* My cell phone will be able to reach you in more places there!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* I should really get an upgrade..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Welcome to Aerialis."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Here you will find the royal lab and the newfound \"rec center.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I have never been to the rec center, but I hear it is nice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Perhaps you could call me again when you get there?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Maybe that way I could hear more about it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* I am afraid do not have much else to say about this area..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* I have heard the royal guards in Aerialis love salmon."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Or was it ice cream?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* Wait, no, I think it was pizza!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* All of which are in short supply on the outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* I wonder if humans still enjoy monster delicacies like these."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* What kind of puzzles do they have in Aerialis?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Are they laser-based?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Do they entangle you back to the start when you fail them?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* My, do we already have enough of that here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* I do not enjoy being moved against my will, thank you very much!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Word of your performances has spread far, little one!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I did not know you had such \"fabulous\" moves."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* I did not know you were such a daring spirit."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* I had no idea you were so skilled with a one- time use jetpack!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I did not know you had such a clever mind for prices."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* I look forward to seeing what you do next!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Barricades, hmm?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* My child. When it comes to getting through walls..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* I am not the one you should call."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Surely the royal scientist would be a better choice, no?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Individuals in that position, they um..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* They tend to become obsessed with getting through walls."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* I will never forget the time we first tried out the elevator."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* That music..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* ... was unspeakable."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Never again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* Please, do not tell me you actually enjoy it!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* So you have found another taxi stop?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Hmm..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I often wonder if they are different from the one in the Outlands"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Of course, I would have no way of knowing until I went there..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* I often wonder if I will ever go there again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Although that place may not evoke the best of feelings for us..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It is still one of my favorite places in the Outlands."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* There is someone I know who visits me here sometimes..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Perhaps you are already aware of him."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Calling so soon...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* ... I have not even gotten back to the house yet!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Please, wait a moment before calling again."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* That is the pathway to the local taxi stop."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* From there, you can access other areas of the outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I don't know the taxi driver very well..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* They can be a bit, er, mysterious."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Oh, that is where Napstablook often stays!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Their company is always nice, even if they do not see it that way."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I have tried comforting them on several occasions..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Nothing seems to cheer them up for long."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I suspect someone else is to blame for their wallows..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Although, lately they have seemed happier..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I do hope their good moods continue."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The Outlands bridge, hmm?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* And to think I was about to..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, there is nothing to worry about now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Carry on, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oh dear, is the vending machine broken again?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* ...\n* I apologize for that, my child."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* That vending machine has broken down more times than I can count."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I fear much of the technology around here is out of date..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Perhaps it's time I replace some of it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Ah, you must be in my front yard."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, I call it it a yard."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It is more of a junction between my home and the exit."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* That room was originally going to be larger..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Then, we realized there would be no use for the extra space."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Interesting, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The very edge of the outpost..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Are you feeling nostalgic, my child?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Or perhaps you are looking for something..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, in any case, please do not stay out for too long."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* You would not want to forget the way back!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oho, I know where you are..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The ambient noise of that room is unmistakable."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* Not to mention, that terminal was much too tall for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Well, most of the terminals in the Outlands are short..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* How odd.\n* That particular one happened to be different."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I must say, I am not proud of how I dealt with that Froggit..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* That could have been a great learning exercise!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I suppose there is no sense in worrying about it now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The past cannot be changed, after all."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The dummy room...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Hee hee, I am still proud of the way you handled that test."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Talking it out is preferable to violence..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Even when it seems unrealistic."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Although you did not handle that test well..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I am sure you learned from it going forward."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* That was the idea, was it not...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Oh, how could I forget the way you ran..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Perhaps you were not ready for a battle at the time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Although, considering what happened between us..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I highly doubt it is an issue for you now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Truthfully, I still do not know how to react to what happened."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It was mesmerising to watch, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Just... the two of you... staring at each other..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Ah, how could I forget how adorable you were..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I have taught many... erm, monsters, how to handle encounters."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* None of them ever did it quite like you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I would even go as far as to say you had the better idea!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* The next time you come across a dummy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Slapping them might not be a great idea."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/4}* Or it is a great idea, and I am simply the crazy one here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Who knows!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/8}* Hahahahaha!\n* Ah- I could not hold in the laughter!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Never in my life did I expect you to FLIRT..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Let alone like the way you did!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Listen to me, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Flirting with your adversaries is almost never ideal."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/10}* But YOU..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* You seem to have a knack for it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Perhaps you could use that to your advantage?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* That is where I introduced myself to you, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Who would have thought you would come all this way."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I suppose there is not much else to say."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Are you leaving the Outlands, my child?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I want you to remember something."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Whatever happens, no matter how terrile..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I want you to know that I have faith in you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I know you want to do the right thing, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I believe you can."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Remember that for me, alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Good luck."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Ah, the room I did not want you to enter."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* And for good reason..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It is where you tend to run into the more, erm, \"active\" monsters."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Ones that believe it is their duty to defend the outpost."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* While they have every right to do so..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* That does not mean I have to agree with it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* This area is but a few steps away from the taxi stop."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Although it is a mostly uninteresting room in the present..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* In the past, we had planned a community area of sorts."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Outlands visitors would be met with a warm, welcoming atmosphere."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Over time, though, our plans for the area changed..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Now, all you can find there are defunct pieces of equipment."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I do wonder..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Did they ever fix the power lines in that room?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, perhaps I should go take a look at that sometime."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Are those monsters STILL sitting there?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* They never seem to be anywhere else..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Truly, it is an odd way to live."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* How does one eat?\n* How does one drink?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* We may never know the answers to these questions, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* The activities room.\n* We host all kinds of performances there."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Drama, dance nights, and the arts, of course..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It is always good to see people expressing themselves."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I once attended a comedy in that very room."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It was the hardest I have ever laughed in my life!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* That area is almost never visited by anyone..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Truthfully, there is a good reason for that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It is the same reason there is a locked door nearby."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Perhaps it would be best if we did not discuss it."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Ah, that must be your room!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I really do hope you like it..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Your... room..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Perhaps it is no longer as such."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Still, I am glad that you could get some rest."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Did you know that my home used to have a basement?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* In fact, it led right to the exit of the Outlands."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* However, there were issues with the gravity in that section, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Well, we do not want monsters floating away, do we?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* My, that would be terrible!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Ah...\n* I see you have stumbled into my room."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* If you like, you may read a book from my bookshelf..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* But please do not forget to put it back."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/23}* Oh, and keep out of my sock drawer!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* There is not much to say about the hallway..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/0}* Though, you can take a look in the mirror, if you like."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I hear self-reflection can be quite useful."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Do you know why there is so much fur in my sink?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* You see, lately, I had to shed quite a bit of mine."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* You can imagine where all of that ended up."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* What? This is perfectly normal for boss monsters."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* There is no need to call me when I am right here, little one."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Rummaging around in the living room, are we?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Say.\n* Have you read all of the books yet?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* There is so much interesting material!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Oh, that is my favorite puzzle room!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* ... that sounded better in my head."
msgstr ""

msgid "<26>{#f/1}* But there is something nice about how it teaches collaboration..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Oh, I sound like a veritable scholar!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Well, actually, my dream job is to become a caregiver."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* There is just something rewarding about helping children grow."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* That is where I found you, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* To think you could have been killed by that awful thing..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/9}* He has been a pest here for some time."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I wonder where he came from..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* All alone out there, by yourself..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It is a good thing I was there to bring you in."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Who knows what awful things could have happened otherwise..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Although it is just a simple taxi stop..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I often see monsters walk out there to take their mind off things."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I suppose, here in the Outlands..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* We really can make anything multi-purpose."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* There is a reason why that room is so long and windy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* The idea was that it would slow down invading human forces."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Can you imagine how difficult it would be..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* For an army of foot soldiers to traverse that path?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well, that was the intention, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It seems that, in truth, we had nothing to worry about."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Calling this early...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* You should really get going, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I promise everything will be okay."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Be good, will you not?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Have you met Sans?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I sure hope he and his brother are taking good care of you."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Nothing less for such a sweet child!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oh, that Sans..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I wonder what you and him have gotten up to by now."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* He may be an OLD SOUL..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* But he's got a real PENSION for humor!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* An old landing pad?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* From your description, it sounds like..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Like the pad I helped set up for the early Starton engineers!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* At the time, Starton was our biggest project to date."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* There were some issues with craft arriving safely..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* So we threw in a spacecraft landing pad for quick access!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Progress on Starton sped up quite a ways, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* ... um, am I rambling again?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Sans has told me all about his brother's fondness for puzzles."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* I hear he has even created some of his own...?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* It sounds exciting."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I would love to try one sometime!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Alas, I must oversee these Outlands..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Please, can somebody explain \"dog justice?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/7}* It is an odd phrase I continue to hear every so often."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I do know of one little puppy that likes to visit the Outlands..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Maybe they are the one who deserves justice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* I wonder what kind of food is sold in Starton these days."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Cakes?\n* Pies?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Well.\n* I sure hope it is nice."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/15}* It better not be rationed ice cream."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Sans's fondness for spot-the-difference puzzles..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Has always been confusing to me."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Knowing him, I get the strangest feeling..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* That there is more to it than meets the eye."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Or, eye-socket in his case, I suppose.\n* Hee hee."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Why would someone want to solve a near- impossible puzzle?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* Sans never stops talking about his brother's spaghetti."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/6}* But just imagine the PASTABILITIES..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* Rigatoni!\n* Fettuccine!\n* Acini di Pepe!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Some variety could really help him go FARFALLE."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Go BIGOLI or go home, as they say!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Math is certainly not my favorite subject..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* ... but it does make for a good puzzle!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Er, most of the time, anyway."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* To my knowledge, Dr. Alphys is the current royal scientist."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Although she may never replace the experience of Dr. Roman..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* I am sure she is more than capable of finding her own path forward."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* This may surprise you, but I have a certain respect for scientists."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Such analytical minds!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* If I were you, I would steer clear of dubious salesfolk."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* You never know what strings they may pull..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/5}* A lesson I have had to learn the hard way, unfortunately."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}* It is fortunate most of Starton is outdoors."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Otherwise, I would not be able to take your calls!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/0}* My, I should think about getting an upgrade."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* With quality this wooden, it is a wonder we can call at all..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* You must have crossed into town by now..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#f/1}* What do you think?"
msgstr ""

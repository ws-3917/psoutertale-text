msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Where the heck is Sans?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He told me he had a star chart I could use to find girls..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I mean, it was probably some kind of prank, but I wanted to know what the prank was!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I \"put out a call\" for some girls today."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Someone told me there are infinite possibilities among the stars..."

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I guess I could ask Undyne.\n* But I think she likes someone else already."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Don't tell me you don't have an OuterNet account..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Let me know if you see him..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Can I ever find love out here?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Despite Sans's vast culinary knowledge, he always orders the worst burger off the menu."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Except for earlier today..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* ...when he ordered the SECOND worst burger off the menu."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* That's something, right?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It's practically fate."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Hmmm, this is around the time that Sans comes in."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Then, a little bit later, his brother comes in."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Yes, his brother.\n* Papyrus."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He's an interesting fellow, and he always orders a glass of milk..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* He says it's \"full of strong bones.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Hmmm...\n* Isn't human food different from monster food?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* It does things like \"spoil.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* And when you eat it, it passes all the way through your body."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* I'd love to try it sometime."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Come to think of it, that's not the only off-putting thing to have happened today..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Can't imagine what it'd take to change a fate like that."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I hope he shows up today.\n* Him and his brother are great at making us laugh."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I've also heard they have things called \"bathrooms.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Skeletons are cool."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Humans are weird."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Sansyyyy...\n* Come back and sit with me...!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Everything's so f-f-fun when you're around..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* H-hey, isn't Sansy s'posed to come swinging in right about now??"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* C'mon Sansy!\n* You're the life of the party..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* It's s-s-so quiet in here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Lighten up everybody!\n* ...\n* I'm really starting to loathe th-this place."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* No matter where I go, it's the same menu, the same people..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* Help!\n* I want new drinks an' h-h-h-hot guys!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Sansyyyy..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I guess the bartender's kind of h-h-h-hot..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* I jus' don't kn-know what to do anymore!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Shoot, I was hoping Sans came to give us a pat on the head."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>{#p/monster}{#npc/a}* Smells kinda... quiet."

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}I WONDER IF HUMANS GO HUNTING FOR MONSTER TRASH."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}SO YOU'VE MADE IT TO THE CENTRAL RING ROOM!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}AT FIRST, WHEN I HEARD THE TERM \"RING ROOM...\""

msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/16}* You know, that reminds me..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/9}* I once wanted the royal guard to have a cooking division."

msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/9}MAYBE YOU JUST DIDN'T ADD ENOUGH MARINARA SAUCE!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/4}* No amount of marinara sauce could fix THAT disaster."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/6}THE LAST TIME I ORDERED IT, THEY..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}WELL, LET'S JUST SAY THE CONCEPT WAS BEYOND THEM."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}IN MY VERY HUMBLE OPINION..."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/5}AND..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}ACTUALLY, LIFE IS ALMOST NOTHING LIKE A CHESS GAME."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}BUT THEY DO HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/0}WHICH IS THAT YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT!"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/1}* So, kind of like a box of tree saps, then."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/6}YEAH, KIND OF LIKE THAT."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}WAIT, ISN'T IT SUPPOSED TO BE A BOX OF CHOCOLATES?"
msgstr ""

msgid "<25>{#p/undyne}{#f/14}* That would be the human expression."
msgstr ""

msgid "<18>{#p/papyrus}{#f/4}OR WAS IT A BOX OF TREE SAPS...?"

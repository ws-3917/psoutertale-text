msgid "<26>{#f/16}* I tried talking to my parents, but they couldn't help me at all."

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/10}* Where were we again?"

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/13}* At first, I didn't know how I got there..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/15}* ... so, I tried bringing myself back on purpose."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/16}* I focused my mind on going back again, and... it worked."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/15}* Somehow, I'd gained the power to turn back time."

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* And that's when it struck me..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/23}* I'd use my new power to be a force for good."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/15}* I thought, maybe, if I couldn't help myself..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/16}* At least I could help someone else."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/16}* ... oh yeah.\n* So I started out by helping them."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/23}* I'll admit, I struggled at first..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/15}* ... but the more I did it, the better I got."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/5}* After a while, I could even do it with my eyes closed."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Heck.\n* Sometimes I did."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/13}* And, sure, maybe I was a bit of a show-off..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/9}* But what did it matter?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/5}* After all, I was still helping them..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/15}* ... saving them..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/15}* Being a good person, and all."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/15}* Like I said before, I started out by helping them."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* Soon, though, I began to notice something."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/15}* The same responses, the same outcomes..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/16}* Just being nice all the time wasn't satisfying me anymore."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/8}* And, yes, before you ask, I did try getting cutesy."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/7}* But even that became boring in the end."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/10}* I could've gone on, but what would've been the point?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/6}* It was time to try something else."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* Like I said before, I decided I'd stop being nice all the time."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/4}* Now, it didn't amount to much at first..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Just a few mean words here and there."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/10}* A part of me felt bad, but what did I really have to lose?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/6}* Of course, once things began to repeat again, I got a little meaner."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/8}* Another insult here, another mockery there..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/7}* Eventually, I stopped feeling bad about it entirely."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/9}* It's not like I was killing them or anything."
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>{#p/asriel2}{#f/4}* Like I said before, I'd gotten used to being mean."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/15}* Then, I thought to myself... if I attacked them..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/16}* It'd be fine, as long as they didn't die."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/10}* What'd be the harm?\n* Monsters can heal, can't they?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/4}* If worst came to worst, I could just RESET, and it'd still be fine."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* ... little did I know how I'd react if it actually happened."
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* Like I said before, I'd gotten the idea to attack them."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/13}* I guess you could say I got carried away..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/15}* Pulled... just a little too tightly..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/16}* ..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/8}* My own mother, strangled to death by my own magic..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/6}* Begging me to stop as the life drained out of her body."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/13}* Even after a RESET, the image wouldn't leave my mind."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/7}* I panicked, and tried making up for it by being nice to her."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/6}* But I couldn't forget about what I'd done."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/15}* I just... couldn't look at her... at anyone... the same way again."
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>{#p/asriel2}{#f/15}* Like I said before, I couldn't forget about what I'd done."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/16}* And, after that, things only got worse."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* After that, things only got worse."
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>{#f/15}* I guess, after screwing up once, it got easier to do it again."
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>{#f/15}* And soon, be it out of frustration, or raw curiosity..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>{#f/16}* What began as an accident spiraled out of control."
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>{#f/7}* But, hey, when it came down to it, I could always RESET, right?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/6}* And once I told myself THAT... there really was no going back."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* With each new RESET, my actions became more and more twisted."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/7}* I subjected them... all of them... to horrors far beyond the pale."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/8}* I did it again, and again, and again..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/7}* I did it so many times, I'd lost count of all the people I killed."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/15}* But it couldn't go on."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/15}* On the last and final day, as stardust razed the sky..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>{#f/16}* I stood alone in an empty world, knowing it was all for nothing."
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>{#f/23}* So I RESET, and let time move forward without me."
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* Like I said before, I knew it was all for nothing."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/23}* So I RESET, and let time move forward without me."

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/17}* Don't you see, $(name)?"

msgid "<25>{#f/13}* With you by my side, I won't have to do it alone anymore."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/15}* With you by my side... it'll finally mean something for once."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/16}* Besides, this is what you've always wanted, isn't it?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/13}* To \"set them free?\""
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/23}* ... heh.\n* We really do make the perfect team."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/17}* Just remember, $(name)."

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* As long we stick together, nothing can stand in our way."

msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/17}* We might as well do it while we still have the chance, right?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/23}* Walking hand-in-hand, past the city, like we always wanted to..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/16}* ... and THEN we'll blow it to pieces."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* Well, that was nice."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/13}* But the outpost's time has come."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/7}* Listen, $(name).\n* These monsters just don't understand us."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/6}* They'd like to pretend that the universe is a perfect place."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/8}* They'd like to think that anyone can be redeemed."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/6}* But you and I?\n* We don't fit within their world view."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/7}* We're irredeemable."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/9}* Heh.\n* Isn't it funny?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/13}* The one thing that keeps us from relating to anyone else..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/16}* ... is precisely what binds us together."
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>{#f/17}* Listen, once we hitch a ride and escape this place..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/17}* We'll be together forever, $(name)."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/23}* It's our destiny."

msgid "<25>{#f/17}* Come on, let's get back to where we were..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/17}* Lead the way."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* ... I'm not going to repeat myself."
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>{#f/13}* You know why we're here."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/8}* ... finally."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/8}* Looks like they've already been evacuated..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/7}* ... hmph."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/6}* If he thinks that'll stop us, then he's just plain stupid."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/10}* I mean, he could've used their power to destroy us..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>{#f/16}* ... but let's be honest."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/13}* He's just not that kind of person, is he?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/6}* Just a moment."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/16}* Meltdown in progress."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/5}* All we need now is a special shuttle..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/9}* One that'll link with our SOULs to let us get past the force field."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/3}* This way."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asriel2}{#f/5}* Gorey!"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/5}* How ya doing?"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""


msgid "<32>* ... at least I'd have people to talk to, right?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<32>* They tried to help me..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<32>* They tried to make me feel at home..."
msgstr ""

msgid "<32>* They were all so young..."

msgid "<32>* Monsters are like children in that way..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<32>* Their innocence is what defines them."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgstr ""


msgid "<32>* At least then, I'd be able to move on from what happened."

msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/0}* ok then, consider our session over."

msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* i suspected something like this."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* you're always acting like you know what's going to happen."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* like you've seen it all before."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/4}* so...\n* i have a request for you."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/0}* i kind of have a {@fill:#ff0}secret codephrase{@fill:#fff} that only i know."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/4}* so i know if someone tells it to me..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/0}* they'll have to be a time traveler."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/2}* crazy, right?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/4}* anyway, here it is..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (Sans whispered something to you.)"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* i'm counting on you to come back here and tell me that."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/2}* see you later."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/4}* huh?\n* do you have something to say to me?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You told Sans the secret codephrase.)"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/2}* what? a codephrase?\n* can you speak a little louder?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You told Sans the secret codephrase, but louder.)"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* did you..."
msgstr ""


msgid "reverse the polarity of the neutron flow?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/2}* wow.\n* i can't believe you would say that."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/4}* not only is that complete nonsense..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/2}* but it's also my secret codephrase."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* so, i guess you're qualified."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/0}* here's the key to my room."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/0}* it's time..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* you learned the truth."
msgstr ""


msgid "<32>{#p/human}* (You got the Skeleton Key.)"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/4}* so..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/0}* ... wait.\n* have you heard this before, too?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* wow, you really ARE a time traveler."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/2}* guess there's not much else to say, then."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/0}* behind you."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/sans}* so this is it, huh?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* this is where your journey ends?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* look.\n* i don't know what asgore's going to do."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/0}* chances are... it won't be what you expect."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* but, just think for a moment..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* everything you've done up until now."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* was it worth it?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* i don't know what's going through your mind right now."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/0}* i mean, i can't even see your face."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* ..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* maybe that's for the best."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/0}* but i do know that for you to have done all this..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* you had to have cared about us at some point, right?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* ... i guess there's every chance that's not true."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/0}* still, people don't just act like this towards strangers."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* i'll bet somewhere, deep down, you really do care about us."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* you certainly cared enough to make it this far, right?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/sans}{#f/3}* i know. the whole \"appeal to emotion\" isn't really my style."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/0}* but what else am i supposed to do?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* when someone goes as far as you have..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* intimidation just doesn't seem appropriate anymore."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* so i'm trying something different."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/0}* ..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* now.\n* if this is really how it ends..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* so be it."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/0}* kindness isn't exactly your thing, and i get that."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* but if, by chance, you've got a {@fill:#ff0}certain power{@fill:#fff}..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* then why not?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* just this once, just at the end..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* just be kind."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* well."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* that's all."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysCutscene1}* You made it!"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#g/alphysCutscene2}* ..."

msgid "<25>{#g/alphysSmileSweat}* Oh, uh, Asgore's waiting for you at the force field."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#g/alphysNeutralSweat}* In case you were wondering."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#g/alphysOhGodNo}* But, i-if you weren't!!\n* Then..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#g/alphysTheFactIs}* Well, then I'm not sure why you're here..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#g/alphysCutscene2}* ... anyway.\n* That's where he is."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysCutscene2}* Uh, I'll just be over here for now."
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>{#p/asgore}{#f/1}* This is the force field."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/2}* It is what keeps us trapped on the outpost."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/1}* An unthinking, unfeeling barrier..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Through which nobody, monster or otherwise, may pass."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/1}* For many years, I lamented that we would never reach the stars."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* I feared that, one day, a human would arrive and doom us all."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/1}* ..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/2}* It seems... this fear was justified."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* Alphys has told me of your... less than peaceful methods."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Though, she did say you spared plenty of our kind as well."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/16}* Why would you do this?\n* I struggle to understand you, child."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/12}* Did it begin as self- defense, and devolve into something worse?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/12}* Or was this your plan from the start?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/5}* ..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>{#f/16}* You place me in a difficult position."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/15}* To trust you with our one key to freedom..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/16}* Or to take your SOUL by force, and enter the archive myself."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* As terrible as you may have been, I do not wish to hurt you."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/4}* You could have been far worse to us..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/2}* ... yet you were not."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/1}* It would be wrong to assume that you are so far beyond the pale."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/2}* You may simply be a very frightened young child."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* It is a shame you had to behave this way."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/1}* All things considered, you have behaved well."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Though, Alphys did mention that you've... taken lives."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/2}* Though, Alphys did mention that you might have... taken lives."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/3}* I only have myself to blame for this."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/2}* My keeping of secrets has made it difficult to escort you quickly."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Especially since this is Alphys's first time doing it."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/15}* ... it is what it is."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/16}* The archive lies ahead of you now."
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>{#f/1}* The other human\n  children all chose to enter the archive, so..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* ... now, it is now your turn to make that same choice."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Then, one by one, the children of earth came."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* All were anxious.\n* All faced challenges on their journeys here."
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>{#f/6}* But, deep down, they let their brightest traits shine through."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* The patient, and the brave."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* The truth-teller and the survivor."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/2}* The kind one..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/4}* And the one who sought justice above all."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/1}* When given the choice to stay, or to enter the archive..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* They all eventually chose the latter."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/1}* Whatever the case may be, I cannot ask you to enter the archive."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/2}* It would be unrealistic to expect you to take such a responsibility."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/5}* Return to my home."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/5}* I will decide what to do with you later."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/6}* As the last to enter, you would act as a vessel."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* Borrowing the others' SOUL power as your own."
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>* With all powers combined, you will\n  destroy the force field."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* Then..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* Monsterkind will search for a new home planet."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/1}* ... however."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* If you do not want such a responsibility..."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* You may stay with us on the outpost until you change your mind."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#f/6}* Whatever you decide, I will support you."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>* Will you enter the archive?"
msgstr ""


msgid "<26>{#p/asgore}{#f/6}* I see you have returned."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asgore}{#f/1}* ..."

msgid "<25>{#p/asgore}{#f/4}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/alphys}{#g/alphysWelp}* Okay, looks like they're in the system."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asgore}{#f/6}* Don't worry."
msgstr ""


msgid "<25>{#p/asgore}{#f/7}* When this archive was created..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* That there be a room designated for stopping and resting."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* In my own life, I often find breaks to be a useful asset."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* The stærmite who resides here would certainly agree..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* For whatever reason, that ghost who often comes here..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* Has been feeling worse than ever lately."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* I tried to ask them why, but they would not say..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* ... I have not seen them since."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* That ghost who called earlier often inhabits this area."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* I thought they would be happier after their performance..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* I have tried to lift their spirits in the past..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* But their troubles may not be so easy to resolve."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* If only I knew what was holding them down..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Has been feeling a lot better lately."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* They even came to my house to tell me so themselves."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Apparently you had something to do with this...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* The activities room.\n"
"* We host all kinds of performances there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Drama, dance nights...\n"
"* And, most important of all, the arts."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* It is always good to see people expressing themselves."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* I once attended a comedy show in that very room."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* It was the hardest I have ever laughed in my life!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* I heard someone here made a \"friend\" with that talking"
" star."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* I heard someone here made a \"friend\" with a talking "
"star."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* One of the Froggits, I presume...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* To say I am worried for that monsters' safety..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* Would be quite the understatement."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The junction room..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* In the past, we had planned a community area of sorts here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Outlands visitors would be met with a warm, welcoming atmosphere."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Over time, though, we realized not many people would come..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* And so, the design was altered into what you see today."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* A little boring, but I suppose not every room can be grand..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}* From here, the all- important taxi stop can be reached."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Not only are other areas of the outpost accessible..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* But other subsections of the Outlands are, too."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Seeing as you are but a small child, however..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/5}* It is unlikely the driver would offer that as an option to you."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* The shops and business there are mostly just for grown-ups."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* A little mushroom greeted me on my way back from "
"shopping..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... as I returned with ingredients for that snail pie."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... as I returned with ingredients for that butterscotch pie."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* Strangely, it was floating above the doorway..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* The gravity must be weak in that room."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Perhaps the presence of the taxi has some kind of effect...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Ah.\n"
"* The courtyard."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Admittedly, it is a little lacking..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* In terms of being a place for children like you to play."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* With every human who came, I thought of fixing that..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* But they always left before I had the chance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* ... the room in which I lectured you about leaving."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* I thought, if I spoke of the force field..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* I might convince you to stay."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* ... I remember telling the other humans the same, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* It was as effective for you as it was for them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* ... the room in which I warned you of the dangers ahead."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* I have been told my beliefs about them are misguided, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* I felt it unwise to take that chance."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}* ... perhaps it is time I re-considered my viewpoint."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* ... I truly regret the way I acted towards you here."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* It was wrong of me to attempt to force you to stay..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* Merely acting on my own silly desires."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* I am sure you have already forgiven me, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* Regardless of whether or not I deserve it..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#s/phone}{#p/event}* Dialing..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Although that room may not evoke the best of feelings "
"for us..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* It is still one of my favorite places in the Outlands."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* There is a certain someone who visits sometimes..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}* Perhaps you are already aware of him."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#s/equip}{#p/event}* Click..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Calling so soon...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... I have not even gotten back to the house yet!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Please, wait a moment before calling again."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#w.stopThatGoat}{#s/phone}{#p/event}* Dialing..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... I have not even left the room yet!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* A moment to breathe would be nice!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#w.startThatGoat}{#s/equip}{#p/event}* Click..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The bridge to the rest of the outpost..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* It is a shame to think I almost destroyed it."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Of course, the taxi still would have been around."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* But I doubt that would have been very reliable."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Let us be glad this bridge is still in place."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* My child, if you are leaving the Outlands..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Then... I want you to remember something."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Whatever happens, no matter how difficult it may seem..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I want you to know that I have faith in you."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* That I know you can do the right thing."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Remember that, alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Returning to the Outlands so soon...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Well.\n"
"* I cannot say I am opposed to that."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* You may leave at any time, of course..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* But, for the moment, it is nice to see you."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* How long have you been standing out there!?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Did you come back all this way just to call me?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... silly goose."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* If you would like to call, there is no need to go back this far."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Did you know that this house is a re-creation of "
"another?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* In the past, I lived in the Citadel..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* In a house that this one was made to resemble."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* Once in a while, I forget that I am not really there..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* There is not much to say about thehallway."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Though, you can take a look in the mirror, if you like..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I hear self-reflection can be a powerful thing."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Ah, it is your room!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* Your... room..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* Perhaps it is no longer as such."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Actually, I will leave that decision to you..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* You may still rest any time you like."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* So you have stumbled into my room."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* If you like, you may read a book from my bookshelf."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* But, please, do not forget to put it back."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/23}* And don't you dare open that sock drawer!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* There is no need to call me when I am right here, little"
" one."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Rummaging around in the living room, are we?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Say.\n"
"* Have you read all of the books yet?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* I thought about reading you the snail fact book..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* But I decided it might be a little too repetitive for you."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The kitchen...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I left a chocolate bar in the fridge for you."
msgstr ""
">{#f/0}* 我在冰箱裡給你留了條\n"
"  巧克力棒。"

msgid ">{#f/0}* I hear it is... an old favorite of humans."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* If I am right, a certain friend of mine should be up "
"ahead."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Do not fear, little one."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Keep going..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* From what I recall, this long room..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* ... would have been the basis for a town on the outskirts of "
"Starton."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Of course, that never came to pass."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* One town was more than enough!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I presume by now you have heard of the \"gravometric "
"inverter?\""
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* It is a device Sans has told me all about."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Apparently, there is another world up there..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* A place where things do not always face the right way up."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* This old landing pad was once a bustling intersection..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Supply ships coming and going..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Ready to aid in whatever was being built next..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* It is a shame the outpost seems to have stopped expanding."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* For a while, building new areas defined our culture!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}* I heard Sans's brother wants to join the Royal Guard someday."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Such an aspirational young skeleton..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Despite my feelings about the guard, it is good for him to dream."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* I worry that too many have given up on their dreams lately..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* But not him!\n"
"* That skeleton knows what is best for him."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}* Sans told me all about the gadgets Papyrus added to his "
"station."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* First, a handle, so he can \"swing\" into duty..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* A so-called \"sky wrench\" used to get a \"fix\" on the stars..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* And a screen attachment to keep track of his many responsibilities."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/6}* With inventions like these, you would think he works at a lab."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Is the Royal Guard giving you too much trouble?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Sans did say he would warn you of potential encounters."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Perhaps I should be more worried, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Something tells me you will be alright."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I have faith in that skeleton to look out for you."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Ah, what a lovely sound..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I would recognize a builder bot anywhere."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* After the ban on AI programs, we had most of them disabled..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* But the two whose sentience did not corrupt them..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Were allowed a more graceful retirement."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* It is nice to know that they have survived to this day."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}* Sans has told me all about his brother's fondness for puzzles."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* I hear he has even created some of his own...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I am most curious about the \"wall of fire.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/1}* Are the flames hot?\n"
"* Or are they merely pleasantly warm?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* For your sake, I would hope it is the latter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I hear the Royal Guard employs a pair of married dogs."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* To be married at the same time as being a royal guard..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/4}* That relationship must have some \"interesting\" motivations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/6}* But what do I know.\n"
"* As Sans would say, I am merely a \"goat!\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}* I wonder what kind of food is sold in Starton these days."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* When I was last here, everyone loved to eat ghost fruit..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* A strange food which could be eaten both by ghosts and non-ghosts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Whatever the favorite\n"
"  is now, I am sure I could never dream of it."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Sans's fondness for spot-the-difference puzzles..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Well, it has never really made sense to me."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* How could such a simple puzzle be appealing to him?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* ... more specifically..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Where is the humor in such a puzzle?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}* Sans has often spoken of Papyrus's interest in spaghetti "
"dishes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/6}* But why stop there?\n"
"* Just imagine the PASTABILITIES..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/8}* Rigatoni!\n"
"* Fettuccine!\n"
"* Acini di Pepe!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Some variety could really help him go FARFALLE."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* ... in other words, go BIGOLI or go home!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Whatever the puzzles in Starton are like now, I am "
"sure..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* They are nothing like the ones that were here when I left."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* A level of difficulty so unrealistic..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* It is a wonder anyone could solve them at all."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* They say some puzzles have secret solutions..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... a statement I find utterly unbelievable!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* A secret solution would defeat the whole purpose of a puzzle."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Puzzles, at least ones with realistic difficulty..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* Should be solved the intended way only!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}* To my knowledge, Dr. Alphys is the current royal scientist."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/1}* She may never replace the experience of her predecessor, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* I am sure she is more than capable of finding her own path forward."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* This may surprise you, but I have a certain respect for scientists."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* Such brilliant minds!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* You would be wise to steer clear of dubious salesfolk..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* For you never know what strings they may pull."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Or what moon rocks may end up falling into your lap."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* It is a lesson I have learned the hard way, unfortunately..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The puzzle in this room is one of memorization, is it "
"not?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Sans mentioned that his brother often updates the pattern..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... to maintain a strong \"rotating password.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}* How silly!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* In the Outlands, our memorization puzzles update on-demand."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The old owner of that doghouse, Canis Maximus..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... retired from the guard a long while ago."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/7}* Fortunately, its new owner is said to be a bundle of puppy energy!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Clearly, it has learned well from such a wise master."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Please, can somebody explain \"dog justice?\""
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* It is an odd phrase I continue to hear every so often."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/5}* I do know of one little puppy that visits the Outlands sometimes..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Perhaps that is who is deserving of justice."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* When this bridge was first constructed..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Its precarious nature prompted an upgrade to the outpost's systems."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* In short time, the aptly-named \"gravity guardrails\" were added."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* These are what prevent you from falling off the platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Ah...\n"
"* The town of Starton."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* I have heard much about a \"Grillby's\" there..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... and its diverse array of patrons both new and old."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Sans often goes there to eat, you see."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}* I hear the bartender is quite \"hot.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* A taxi stop near town?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* ... hmm..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I wonder if it is any different from the one in the Outlands."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Of course, I would have no way of knowing until I saw it..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Which I have no way of doing without a fancy telescope."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I wonder where I could find one of those."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Napstablook recently told me they opened a shop..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* ... on the \"south side\" of town."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* What could this mean?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* The town I remember organizing was a large, unified square."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Perhaps there was a split at some point?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* That would be a shame, considering the original vision..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The thing Sans seemed most eager to warn me about..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Was his brother's so- called \"special attack.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/1}* If Papyrus chooses to spar with you, you must avoid it at all "
"costs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/2}* I repeat, avoid the special attack!\n"
"* At all costs!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* That is all I have to say on this matter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* If you ever decide to leave Starton, you must "
"understand..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/5}* My phone is old, and can only reach certain rooms in the factory."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}* It would be difficult to call me until you find your way out."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/1}* Forgive me.\n"
"* I just thought that I should let you know."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/7}* So you found a place in the factory with good "
"reception...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* ... that must mean you are somewhere unenclosed..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Which also implies the nearby presence of synth-bushes."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* Those things are terrible to get stuck in..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/4}* Getting you all itchy and scratchy..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Fortunately, I know you are smart enough not to run into them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* There truly is nothing like the chirp of that fearless "
"little bird."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Even when it still lived within a bucket of water..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* It would fly its mighty little wings..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Taking us places..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I used its services to carry groceries often."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* ... back when we as a species all lived in that old factory."
msgstr ""

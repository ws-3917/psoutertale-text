">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I hear there is a certain kind of fluid in Aerialis..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Used primarily to dampen electricity."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* If you could carry this fluid, how far would you take it?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Would you carry it all the way to the Citadel?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Or would you simply dispose of it in a recycle bin?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* How disappointing that would be."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Perhaps, if I ever become a teacher..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I could host a field trip to the Royal Lab."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* With Dr. Alphys's permission, of course."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* All those interesting experiments they must conduct there..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* It'd be a great learning experience for the children."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Word of your TV premier has spread quickly, little one!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Though, I have not seen it, due to my lack of a TV."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/1}* When I heard about it, however, I must admit I was surprised..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* How did you not miss even a SINGLE time?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}* I did not know you had such \"fabulous\" moves."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Hmm...\n"
"* The royal guards in Aerialis..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Apparently, their favorite food is... salmon."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Or... was it ice cream?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* Wait, no, I think it was pizza!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* All of which would be impossible without the humble replicator."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* And... are those not strange foods for such new recruits?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* I hear you have appeared on TV, little one."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* I hear you have appeared on TV again, little one."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* I also hear you did something shocking..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* And altered crafting ingredients to create plastic explosive!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/2}* And held your ground against the threat of an impending explosion!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* And flew a \"one-time use portable jetpack\" by yourself!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* ... are you..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/4}* Are you TRYING to put your life in danger?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* What kind of puzzles do they have in Aerialis?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Are they laser-based?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Do they bring you back to the start when you fail?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* ... can they be explicitly \"failed\" as such?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Hmm...\n"
"* Pardon me for asking so many questions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/1}* A fan of puzzles like myself cannot help but ponder these things..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* When hearing about your hijinks with Mettaton..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I had a thought."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/1}* How could a robot like him exist after the ban on AI programs?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/5}* Surely Dr. Alphys would not break such a well- established rule."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* No...\n"
"* There must be some other explanation."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I heard they were only just promoted to their positions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/1}* I also heard they are quite picky about their choice of weapons..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* Refuse to upgrade them despite better options on offer."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Not that I want them to upgrade their weapons."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* I worry about you enough as it is!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* A ghost, Lurksalot, recently spoke of some family "
"business."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* It seems this has been on their mind for some time."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Thankfully, they say it should be resolved soon."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* And with the help of you, no less?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Well then.\n"
"* I am very proud of you, little one."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* They say their cousin tried to ask for your help, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* You were unavailable at the time."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* ... you did have a good reason, did you not?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Who knew a robot could have such a beautiful voice?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Upon hearing Mettaton's new recording, I could not believe my ears."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/1}* Though, some of the lyrics were a touch... violent, for my taste."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Do not worry, my child.\n"
"* Nobody is going to cast you out into space."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Sans tells me the \"rec center\" is a favored location "
"of his."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Art classes, music clubs, libraries..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* It is a shame much of the area is unsafe for young "
"children."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* Could they not put a little more effort into being "
"accommodating?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* Those mediums can offer valuable transformative "
"experiences!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Everyone I know is upset about a cancelled \"grand "
"finale.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* They say it would have been quite the fight."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* While I am relieved you did not have to take on such a "
"battle..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* I cannot help but worry for what awaits you now."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Everyone I know has been talking about a \"grand "
"finale.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* They say Mettaton gave his life for the good of the "
"show..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* But I know better."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* After all, robots can be repaired, can they not?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* They say watching you and Mettaton really made them "
"happy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* While I am glad that you appear to have had a good "
"time..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Are you still doing alright out there, little one?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* You have probably been to the Citadel by now."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/10}* Be good, won't you?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* I apologize, little one.\n"
"* I have once again turned off my phone."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* Please, leave me here for the time being."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/10}* I will return to you and the others in due time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/basic}* If only there was some hidden method of unlocking this drawer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">* Sorry, did I say \"drawer?\"\n"
"* Surely there aren't any of those in the Outlands."

msgid ""
">{#p/basic}* There is a door here.\n"

">{#p/basic}* Is that... him?\n"

msgid ">{#f/6}* ... you're wrong!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/basic}* Haha... look who's talking now.\n"
"* Mister \"just go be with the people who love you.\""

msgid ">{#p/asriel1}{#f/23}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/23}* $(name)..."

msgid ">{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* But..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/15}* How are you still..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/basic}* ... does it matter?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">* You were right to forget about me the way you did back there."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* The truth is, I've been a terrible person..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* And I'm not the friend, or the sibling you wish you had."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* $(name), I..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/basic}* It's alright, Asriel."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* You don't have to make it out to be better than it is."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel1}{#f/22}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/22}* ... why now?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/basic}* Well..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* I always thought humanity was beyond redemption."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* That, no matter what..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* If you were human... you were doomed to fall into darkness."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* But after following Frisk along on their journey..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* I understand the truth."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">* The other humans... always did something that made it easy to ignore this"
" truth."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* They'd attack people, or worse, make them... disappear."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* But not Frisk."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">* No matter what struggles they faced, they showed kindness and mercy at "
"every turn."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* They... proved me wrong."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">* And now, because of that, I know there's no excuse for the way I treated "
"you."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* Everything you went through, everything you lost..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* I'm the one to blame for it."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* $(name)..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/15}* Have you been conscious this whole time?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/basic}* ... yeah.\n"
"* I guess I have."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">* This has been my existence, Asriel...\n"
"* Ever since we died."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* And... there's something else I have to tell you."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel1}{#f/21}* What is it?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/basic}* Remember when we crossed the force field together?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">* When we arrived at the ruins of the old homeworld, and got found out by "
"those humans?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">* I wanted to use our power to destroy them... but you stopped me, "
"remember?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel1}{#f/16}* ... right."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/basic}* I didn't understand it back then, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* I get it now."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">* ... you were just trying to stop me... from making a terrible mistake."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel1}{#f/15}* $(name)..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/basic}* If not for you, the outpost would've been destroyed in a second"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
">* If not for you, the very same monsters I was supposedly trying to save..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* ... would have died right along with us."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel1}{#f/25}* $(name), I..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/basic}* Even now, your choice back then still matters."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* Even now..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* You're still a better sibling to me than I ever was."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel1}{#f/25}* I forgive you, $(name)!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/23}* Alright?\n"
"* You don't have to do this..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/22}* I know how strongly you felt back then, and..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/15}* I wouldn't want you to change your mind just because I..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/basic}* No.\n"
"* Not anymore."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* People CAN change, Asriel..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* Isn't that what you always believed?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* ... I still do."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/basic}* I've spent the past hundred years wallowing in self-pity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">* I've spent the past hundred years holding a grudge I never should've had."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* In all that time, I wondered what kept me alive..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* And now, I finally know the answer."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel1}{#f/15}* ...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/basic}* ... it's you, Asriel."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* You're the one who's been keeping me alive."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/basic}* Think of it like... an unfulfilled promise."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* Holding that grudge... thinking about you in the way that I did..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* Knowing I could've been so much more for you than I ultimately was."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* All this time, that's what's been holding me back."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel1}{#f/23}* $(name)..."

msgid ">* Even after a hundred years have passed..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* He's still in there, isn't he?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">* Like a little angel..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* Watching over me, protecting me from my own bad choices..."

">{#f/17}* They held on that whole time, just for a chance to see me, "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/13}* Hey.\n"
"* Maybe it won't be so bad."

msgid ">{#f/17}* Having you there with me definitely won't hurt matters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/13}* ...\n"
"* The thing is...\n"
"* If I stayed here now..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/15}* It wouldn't be right by $(name)... you know?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* And besides, with my SOUL back inside of me..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* I won't turn back into a star."

msgid ""
">{#p/asriel1}{#f/17}* Well.\n"

">{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* $(name)'s not stupid.\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}* ... but it doesn't mean I wanted them gone!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* It's not like $(name) has to go away..."

">{#p/asriel1}{#f/13}* One time, $(name) and I were fighting over a bed..."

">{#f/15}* We were both pushing each other off the side, trying to make "

msgid ">{#f/4}* All that fighting got us so tired, that we fell asleep."

msgid ">{#f/17}* We were lying right next to each other."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* I tried to get up, but... they didn't want to let go."

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/15}* \"... fluffy...\""
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/20}* I would have complained about it, but..."

msgid ">{#f/0}* Thankfully, there are several ways to resolve one."

msgid ">{#f/1}* For now, I suggest striking up a friendly conversation..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}* To start, you may practice talking with the dummy."

msgid ""
">{#f/6}* Hahaha!\n"

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* You ran away...?"

msgid ">{#f/1}* By escaping, you have avoided any potential conflict..."

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* What then, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}{#v/1}* Will you KILL out of frustration?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/14}{#v/1}* Or will you simply GIVE UP?"

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* Hee hee hee..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* So you spared the life of almost everyone."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/twinkly}{#f/11}{#v/0}* But what about the one you DID get in the way "
"of, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/twinkly}{#f/11}{#v/0}* But what about the one you DIDN'T spare, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}{#v/0}* The one you killed could've been someone else's Toriel."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}{#v/1}* Someone's dead because of you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/twinkly}{#f/5}{#v/0}* I'm sure you're well aware of that, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}{#v/0}* Considering you've already killed Toriel once before."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}{#v/0}* Ain't that right, brat?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}{#v/1}* You MURDERED her."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/7}{#v/0}* And then, you felt bad...\n"
"* Ain't that right?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* Do you think you're the only one with that power?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/6}{#v/0}* The power to reshape the universe, purely by your "
"determination..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/8}{#v/0}* The power to SAVE..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}{#v/0}* That used to be MY power, you know."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}{#v/0}* Seems YOUR desires for this world override MINE."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/5}{#v/0}* Well then.\n"
"* Enjoy that power while you can."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}{#v/0}* After all, this used to be MY power."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}{#v/0}* I thought I was the only one who could do that."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/twinkly}{#f/11}{#v/0}* You're one hell of a tease, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/8}{#v/0}* Beating monsters to the brink of death, only to let them "
"go..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}{#v/0}* What will you do if a monster doesn't WANT your mercy?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}{#v/0}* Will you snuff the light out of their eyes?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/5}{#v/0}* Or will you realize your faulty \"pacifism\" is for nothing?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/twinkly}{#f/7}{#v/0}* Wow, you're utterly repulsive."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* You got by peacefully..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}{#v/0}* Then, you figured that wasn't good enough for you."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}{#v/1}* So you KILLED her just to see what would happen."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}{#v/0}* You did it out of BOREDOM."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* Don't think I don't know how this works..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}{#v/0}* It's sad, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/twinkly}{#f/11}{#v/0}* Look at you, playing with her life like this..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}{#v/0}* Killing her, leaving her, killing her again..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}{#v/0}* Leaving her, killing her, leaving her again..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* It's fun, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}{#v/0}* Endlessly toying with the lives of others..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/8}{#v/0}* Watching how they react to every possible decision..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* Isn't it thrilling?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}{#v/0}* I wonder what you'll do next."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}{#v/0}* I'll be watching..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/twinkly}{#f/10}{#v/0}* You just can't get enough, can you~"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* How many more times will you KILL her, eh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}{#v/1}* You kinda remind me of myself."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}{#v/0}* Well, cya!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* Again?\n"
"* Golly..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}{#v/1}* You REALLY remind me of myself."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* Again!?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/8}{#v/0}* Wow, you're even worse than I thought."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/twinkly}{#f/5}{#v/0}* So you've finally gotten by peacefully, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/twinkly}{#f/5}{#v/0}* So you've finally decided to show mercy, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}{#v/0}* And after all that KILLING..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* Say, was this your idea all along?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/2}{#v/1}* To get a rush out of her death, then spare her once you got "
"bored?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* What a saint you must think you are."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}{#v/0}* But hey, it's not as if I don't know how this works..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/twinkly}{#f/11}{#v/0}* Hee hee hee..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}{#v/0}* I hope you like your choice."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}{#v/0}* I mean, it's not as if you can go back and change fate."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}{#v/0}* That old woman thought she could break the rules."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/8}{#v/0}* She tried so hard to save you humans..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/6}{#v/0}* But when it came down to it, she couldn't even save herself."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* So you finally caved in and killed someone, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}{#v/0}* Well, I hope you like your choice."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/8}{#v/0}* ... what's wrong?\n"
"* Did she not last as long as you thought?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/6}{#v/0}* Oh, how terrible.\n"
"* Guess not everyone can be beat into submission."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* What an idiot!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}{#v/0}* What a shame for her."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}{#v/0}* As for you..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* Wow."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/7}{#v/0}* And here I thought you were the righteous one for showing "
"mercy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/11}{#v/0}* Hah!\n"
"* What a joke."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}{#v/0}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}{#v/0}* How did it feel to finally satisfy your violent side?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}{#v/1}* I bet it felt GOOD, didn't it?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* I mean, I should know..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/twinkly}{#f/5}{#v/0}* Nice to see you again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/6}{#v/0}* By the way, you're the most boring person in the galaxy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/12}{#v/0}* Getting by peacefully, then going back just to do it again?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/8}{#v/0}* Come on..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}{#v/1}* You know as well as I do that it's KILL or BE killed."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}* Aren't you getting tired of this?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}{#v/1}* You KNOW deep down that part of you wants to hurt her."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/14}{#v/1}* A few good hits, and she'd be dead before your very eyes."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* Wouldn't that be exciting?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/8}{#v/0}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}{#v/0}* See ya, idiot."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/twinkly}{#f/8}{#v/0}* Are you doing this just to see how I react?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}{#v/0}* Is that what this is about?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}{#v/0}* Well, don't expect to get anything else outta me."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}{#v/0}* All this boring pacifism is getting tiresome."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* Now, if something more interesting were to happen..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}{#v/0}* Perhaps I'd be more inclined to talk."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}{#v/0}* Sooner or later, you'll be forced to realize that."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* And when that time comes..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/5}{#v/0}* Well, let's just say I'm interested to see what happens."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}{#v/0}* Good luck!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}{#v/0}* Maybe that's why you killed that one monster."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/8}{#v/0}* I mean, you went almost the whole way without killing "
"anyone..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}{#v/0}* But somewhere along the line, you screwed up."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/5}{#v/0}* All that good karma you had went straight down the toilet."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* Golly, you can't do anything right!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* What a joke!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}{#v/0}* Maybe that's why you killed those other monsters."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/8}{#v/0}* I mean, you had a good run, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}{#v/0}* What's the point in mercy if it doesn't mean anything?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}{#v/0}* And believe me, after you did what you did..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}{#v/1}* It doesn't mean JACK."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/11}{#v/0}* What's wrong with killing Toriel, huh?\n"
"* Too good for that?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}{#v/1}* I know you're still rotten to the core."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/11}{#v/0}* I mean, you managed to take out everyone in your path..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}{#v/0}* But when it came to the final hurdle, you failed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* Back again, huh?\n"
"* Golly..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/8}{#v/0}* You've changed the timeline around so much..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}{#v/0}* I don't even know what to think now."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/8}{#v/0}* Are you good?\n"
"* Evil?\n"
"* Just curious?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}{#v/0}* I dunno."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}{#v/0}* There is one thing, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}{#v/0}* One thing I KNOW you haven't done yet."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}{#v/0}* That's right."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}{#v/0}* You haven't killed everyone here in one run yet."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}{#v/0}* Aren't you at least a LITTLE curious?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/8}{#v/0}* Come on, $(name)..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}{#v/0}* I know you're in there somewhere."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/twinkly}{#f/6}{#v/0}* Well well, we meet again."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/8}{#v/0}* How many times is this now?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/6}{#v/0}* Whatever.\n"
"* Doesn't matter."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}{#v/0}* You KNOW what you have to do, $(name)."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}{#v/0}* I'll be waiting."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* You wish to return \"home,\" do you not?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}* If you leave here, I will not be able to protect you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/9}* I will not be able to save you from the dangers that lie ahead."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* So, please, little one..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}* Go back the other way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* Every human that ends up here meets the same fate."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}* I have seen it repeat time and time again."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* They come."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* They leave."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}* ... they die."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* My child..."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/9}* They...\n"

"* Will take your SOUL."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* I did not want to say this, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}* I cannot allow you to continue this way."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}* For your own sake, child..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}* Do not follow me into the next room."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#p/toriel}{#f/13}* ..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/10}* ... of course."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}* Perhaps it was always meant to come to this."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}* Perhaps I was foolish to think you would be any different."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* I am afraid there is little choice now."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/13}* Forgive me, my child..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/11}* But I cannot allow you to leave."

msgid ">{#f/0}* It was still endearing nonetheless."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Surprisingly, you are the first human to try the approach."

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Oh, right, about that."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* I recently discovered that a ghost was hiding in the "

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* They seemed bothered about something, but..."

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* After a little talk, I helped to calm them down."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Hmm... I wonder where Lurksalot is now?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* In times like this, it is important that we show respect."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/10}* ... do you understand?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/9}* It is a lesson more important than that of puzzles or encounters."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The riddle offered by the terminal in that room..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Was based on something I found in an old Earth legend."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* It involved a series of many intricate puzzles..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* And a certain deceptive baked good."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* It is a shame you refused to solve it."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Seeing you solve it was quite gratifying."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* As overseer of the Outlands, I took it upon myself..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* To ensure the other monsters did not attack you."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Both they and I have a mutual understanding about this."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* That is why the Froggit left so readily."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* My idea with building this room to be so long and "
"windy..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... was that I felt a straight room would be too boring."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/1}* After all, who wants to walk in a straight line all their life?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* A little change of pace can be quite nice."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}* From this room forward, more monsters may be found."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* They often like to \"hang out\" here.\n"
"* Nice, is it not?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* It tended to be a quiet place, until recently..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* When a monster began teaching the others how to flirt."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* This new element has greatly altered the social atmosphere."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The vending machine has yet to break down?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Oh dear, is the vending machine broken again?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* Well, it has happened more times than I can count."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* On the positive side, it DOES save power..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... so perhaps it is not all bad."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* To ease the process of retrying the puzzle..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I installed a system to move you back to the start."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* The scientist who helped to install it is long gone now..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* But his work continues to be of use every day."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Ah, a most unique form of puzzle exists here."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* One that tests patience over memorization."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* For the most part, the other humans complained about it..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Though, one did appreciate the value it provides."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* A little trick you may find helpful for this puzzle..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Is that you can start moving even as the sequence is shown."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* ... I suppose that is not of much use to you now."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* But, if for some reason you need to solve it again..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* You may try the advice I have just given."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* It has come to my attention that, recently..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Old editions of a now- defunct comic series are being sold."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Perhaps, if you are bored, you could buy one."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Children your age tend to be rather fond of these things!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* As a matter of principle, I find it important..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* That there be a room designated for stopping and resting."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* In my own life, I often find breaks to be a useful asset."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* The stærmite who resides here would certainly agree..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* For whatever reason, that ghost who often comes here..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* Has been feeling worse than ever lately."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* I tried to ask them why, but they would not say..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* ... I have not seen them since."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* That ghost who called earlier often inhabits this area."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* I thought they would be happier after their performance..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* I have tried to lift their spirits in the past..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* But their troubles may not be so easy to resolve."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* If only I knew what was holding them down..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Has been feeling a lot better lately."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* They even came to my house to tell me so themselves."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Apparently you had something to do with this...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* The activities room.\n"
"* We host all kinds of performances there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Drama, dance nights...\n"
"* And, most important of all, the arts."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* It is always good to see people expressing themselves."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* I once attended a comedy show in that very room."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* It was the hardest I have ever laughed in my life!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* I heard someone here made a \"friend\" with that talking"
" star."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* I heard someone here made a \"friend\" with a talking "
"star."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* One of the Froggits, I presume...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* To say I am worried for that monsters' safety..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* Would be quite the understatement."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The junction room..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* In the past, we had planned a community area of sorts here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Outlands visitors would be met with a warm, welcoming atmosphere."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Over time, though, we realized not many people would come..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* And so, the design was altered into what you see today."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* A little boring, but I suppose not every room can be grand..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}* From here, the all- important taxi stop can be reached."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Not only are other areas of the outpost accessible..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* But other subsections of the Outlands are, too."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Seeing as you are but a small child, however..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/5}* It is unlikely the driver would offer that as an option to you."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* The shops and business there are mostly just for grown-ups."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* A little mushroom greeted me on my way back from "
"shopping..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... as I returned with ingredients for that snail pie."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... as I returned with ingredients for that butterscotch pie."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* Strangely, it was floating above the doorway..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* The gravity must be weak in that room."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Perhaps the presence of the taxi has some kind of effect...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Ah.\n"
"* The courtyard."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Admittedly, it is a little lacking..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* In terms of being a place for children like you to play."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* With every human who came, I thought of fixing that..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* But they always left before I had the chance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* ... the room in which I lectured you about leaving."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* I thought, if I spoke of the force field..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* I might convince you to stay."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* ... I remember telling the other humans the same, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* It was as effective for you as it was for them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/9}* ... the room in which I warned you of the dangers ahead."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* I have been told my beliefs about them are misguided, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* I felt it unwise to take that chance."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}* ... perhaps it is time I re-considered my viewpoint."

msgid ">{#f/5}* It was wrong of me to attempt to force you to stay..."

msgid ">{#f/5}* Merely acting on my own silly desires."

msgid ">{#f/1}* I am sure you have already forgiven me, though..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* Regardless of whether or not I deserve it..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#s/phone}{#p/event}* Dialing..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Although that room may not evoke the best of feelings "

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* It is still one of my favorite places in the Outlands."

msgid ">{#f/1}* There is a certain someone who visits sometimes..."

msgid ">{#f/6}* Perhaps you are already aware of him."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#s/equip}{#p/event}* Click..."

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Calling so soon...?"

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#w.startThatGoat}{#s/equip}{#p/event}* Click..."

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The bridge to the rest of the outpost..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* It is a shame to think I almost destroyed it."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Of course, the taxi still would have been around."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* But I doubt that would have been very reliable."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Let us be glad this bridge is still in place."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* My child, if you are leaving the Outlands..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Then... I want you to remember something."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Whatever happens, no matter how difficult it may seem..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I want you to know that I have faith in you."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* That I know you can do the right thing."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Remember that, alright?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Returning to the Outlands so soon...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Well.\n"
"* I cannot say I am opposed to that."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* You may leave at any time, of course..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* But, for the moment, it is nice to see you."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/2}* How long have you been standing out there!?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Did you come back all this way just to call me?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... silly goose."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* If you would like to call, there is no need to go back this far."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Did you know that this house is a re-creation of "
"another?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* In the past, I lived in the Citadel..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* In a house that this one was made to resemble."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* Once in a while, I forget that I am not really there..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* There is not much to say about thehallway."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Though, you can take a look in the mirror, if you like..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I hear self-reflection can be a powerful thing."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Ah, it is your room!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* Your... room..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* Perhaps it is no longer as such."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Actually, I will leave that decision to you..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* You may still rest any time you like."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* So you have stumbled into my room."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* If you like, you may read a book from my bookshelf."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* But, please, do not forget to put it back."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/23}* And don't you dare open that sock drawer!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/3}* There is no need to call me when I am right here, little"

msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Rummaging around in the living room, are we?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Say.\n"
"* Have you read all of the books yet?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* I thought about reading you the snail fact book..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* But I decided it might be a little too repetitive for you."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The kitchen...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I left a chocolate bar in the fridge for you."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I hear it is... an old favorite of humans."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* If I am right, a certain friend of mine should be up "
"ahead."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Do not fear, little one."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Keep going..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* From what I recall, this long room..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* ... would have been the basis for a town on the outskirts of "
"Starton."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Of course, that never came to pass."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* One town was more than enough!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I presume by now you have heard of the \"gravometric "
"inverter?\""
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* It is a device Sans has told me all about."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Apparently, there is another world up there..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* A place where things do not always face the right way up."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* This old landing pad was once a bustling intersection..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Supply ships coming and going..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Ready to aid in whatever was being built next..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* It is a shame the outpost seems to have stopped expanding."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* For a while, building new areas defined our culture!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}* I heard Sans's brother wants to join the Royal Guard someday."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Such an aspirational young skeleton..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Despite my feelings about the guard, it is good for him to dream."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* I worry that too many have given up on their dreams lately..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* But not him!\n"
"* That skeleton knows what is best for him."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}* Sans told me all about the gadgets Papyrus added to his "
"station."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* First, a handle, so he can \"swing\" into duty..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* A so-called \"sky wrench\" used to get a \"fix\" on the stars..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* And a screen attachment to keep track of his many responsibilities."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/6}* With inventions like these, you would think he works at a lab."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Is the Royal Guard giving you too much trouble?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Sans did say he would warn you of potential encounters."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Perhaps I should be more worried, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Something tells me you will be alright."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I have faith in that skeleton to look out for you."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Ah, what a lovely sound..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I would recognize a builder bot anywhere."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* After the ban on AI programs, we had most of them disabled..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* But the two whose sentience did not corrupt them..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Were allowed a more graceful retirement."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* It is nice to know that they have survived to this day."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}* Sans has told me all about his brother's fondness for puzzles."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* I hear he has even created some of his own...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I am most curious about the \"wall of fire.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/1}* Are the flames hot?\n"
"* Or are they merely pleasantly warm?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* For your sake, I would hope it is the latter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* I hear the Royal Guard employs a pair of married dogs."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* To be married at the same time as being a royal guard..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/4}* That relationship must have some \"interesting\" motivations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/6}* But what do I know.\n"
"* As Sans would say, I am merely a \"goat!\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}* I wonder what kind of food is sold in Starton these days."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* When I was last here, everyone loved to eat ghost fruit..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* A strange food which could be eaten both by ghosts and non-ghosts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Whatever the favorite\n"
"  is now, I am sure I could never dream of it."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Sans's fondness for spot-the-difference puzzles..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Well, it has never really made sense to me."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* How could such a simple puzzle be appealing to him?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* ... more specifically..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Where is the humor in such a puzzle?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}* Sans has often spoken of Papyrus's interest in spaghetti "
"dishes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/6}* But why stop there?\n"
"* Just imagine the PASTABILITIES..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/8}* Rigatoni!\n"
"* Fettuccine!\n"
"* Acini di Pepe!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Some variety could really help him go FARFALLE."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* ... in other words, go BIGOLI or go home!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Whatever the puzzles in Starton are like now, I am "
"sure..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* They are nothing like the ones that were here when I left."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* A level of difficulty so unrealistic..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* It is a wonder anyone could solve them at all."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* They say some puzzles have secret solutions..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... a statement I find utterly unbelievable!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* A secret solution would defeat the whole purpose of a puzzle."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Puzzles, at least ones with realistic difficulty..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* Should be solved the intended way only!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}* To my knowledge, Dr. Alphys is the current royal scientist."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/1}* She may never replace the experience of her predecessor, but..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* I am sure she is more than capable of finding her own path forward."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* This may surprise you, but I have a certain respect for scientists."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* Such brilliant minds!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* You would be wise to steer clear of dubious salesfolk..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* For you never know what strings they may pull."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Or what moon rocks may end up falling into your lap."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* It is a lesson I have learned the hard way, unfortunately..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The puzzle in this room is one of memorization, is it "
"not?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Sans mentioned that his brother often updates the pattern..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... to maintain a strong \"rotating password.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/6}* How silly!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* In the Outlands, our memorization puzzles update on-demand."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The old owner of that doghouse, Canis Maximus..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... retired from the guard a long while ago."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/7}* Fortunately, its new owner is said to be a bundle of puppy energy!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Clearly, it has learned well from such a wise master."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Please, can somebody explain \"dog justice?\""
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* It is an odd phrase I continue to hear every so often."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/5}* I do know of one little puppy that visits the Outlands sometimes..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Perhaps that is who is deserving of justice."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* When this bridge was first constructed..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Its precarious nature prompted an upgrade to the outpost's systems."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* In short time, the aptly-named \"gravity guardrails\" were added."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* These are what prevent you from falling off the platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Ah...\n"
"* The town of Starton."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* I have heard much about a \"Grillby's\" there..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* ... and its diverse array of patrons both new and old."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Sans often goes there to eat, you see."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/7}* I hear the bartender is quite \"hot.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* A taxi stop near town?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* ... hmm..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I wonder if it is any different from the one in the Outlands."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Of course, I would have no way of knowing until I saw it..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Which I have no way of doing without a fancy telescope."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I wonder where I could find one of those."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Napstablook recently told me they opened a shop..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* ... on the \"south side\" of town."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* What could this mean?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* The town I remember organizing was a large, unified square."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Perhaps there was a split at some point?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* That would be a shame, considering the original vision..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* The thing Sans seemed most eager to warn me about..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Was his brother's so- called \"special attack.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/1}* If Papyrus chooses to spar with you, you must avoid it at all "
"costs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/2}* I repeat, avoid the special attack!\n"
"* At all costs!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* That is all I have to say on this matter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* If you ever decide to leave Starton, you must "
"understand..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/5}* My phone is old, and can only reach certain rooms in the factory."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/9}* It would be difficult to call me until you find your way out."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/1}* Forgive me.\n"
"* I just thought that I should let you know."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/7}* So you found a place in the factory with good "
"reception...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* ... that must mean you are somewhere unenclosed..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Which also implies the nearby presence of synth-bushes."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/3}* Those things are terrible to get stuck in..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/4}* Getting you all itchy and scratchy..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Fortunately, I know you are smart enough not to run into them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* There truly is nothing like the chirp of that fearless "
"little bird."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Even when it still lived within a bucket of water..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* It would fly its mighty little wings..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Taking us places..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I used its services to carry groceries often."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* ... back when we as a species all lived in that old factory."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/5}* Things sound awfully silent where you are..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* Almost like there is something missing."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* Something important..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Well, no matter.\n"
"* My imagination does run wild sometimes."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* So you found the factory's taxi stop...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Perhaps you could use it to escape that Royal Guard captain."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* A visitor here once spoke of her obsession with spears..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* How odd.\n"
"* The captain I knew was into sabers."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/0}* Ah, there you are."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* You're at the edge of the factory there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/1}* From this point forward, I do not know what lies ahead of you..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/5}* Before I left, there was only an elevator to the Citadel."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/1}* Now, however, exists the area called \"Aerialis...\""
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/23}* ... I wonder who came up with THAT name."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/2}* Come back to the house this instant!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/23}* Are you not exhausted after how you behaved towards me?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Are you not exhausted after waiting so long?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* Are you not exhausted after all you have been through?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#f/0}* Perhaps you should see the bed I made for you in the guest room."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Perhaps you should see the bed I made for you at the house."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Come to the hallway, and I will show you something."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* Come to the house, and I will show you something."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#p/human}* (But the line was busy.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#p/toriel}{#f/1}* There is no need to call me over the phone, my child."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/23}* We already know what that tends to result in."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* After all, I am here in the room with you."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* I will be done in just a moment."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* If you want to see me, you can wait in the living room."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* If you want to see me, you can come to the living room."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#f/0}* If you want to see me, you can come to the house."
msgstr ""

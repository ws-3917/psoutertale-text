msgid ">{#k/0/6}* So Alphys has always been, like..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/0/0}* ... super duper smart."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/2/4}* Like..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* UNNATURALLY smart."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/0/0}* Like, she can calculate a derivative in her head..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/0/2}* ... in five seconds FLAT!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/0/0}* It's MEGA impressive and all..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#k/2/5}* ... but as a result, she struggles with her impulses sometimes."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/1/6}* I remember that time she called in half the Royal Guard..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/5/4}* ... when she thought she saw some \"interesting trash.\""

msgid ">{#k/2/6}* It's like..."

msgid ">* She doesn't process things the way most people do."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/5/8}* But we love her for that, don't we?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">* But we still think she's A-MAZ-ING!"

msgid ">{#k/4/0}* So like... OBVIOUSLY Asgore made her the royal scientist."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/0/2}* Oh, for sure!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/0/0}* Oh right, THAT goofy goober."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/0/8}* Oh yeah, THAT furry fuzzball!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/2/0}* So like, here's the thing about Asgore..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* ... he's one of the NICEST guys you'll ever meet."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/2/0}* But, at the same time..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/2/4}* ... the stuff everyone wants him to do..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/4/5}* ... it's kind of gross."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* ... it's just plain awful."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/2/6}* I heard Undyne lobbied to expand the Royal Guard."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/2/6}* Yeah, didn't Asgore, like, not even want one to begin with?"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/2/4}* ... the stuff you've been up to out there..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/4/5}* ... well, it's making his job a little tougher."
msgstr ""

msgid ">* ... well, it's making his life a little harder."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/2/6}* Like..."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/2/6}* ... maybe try NOT to kill anyone else, y'know?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">{#k/3/6}* Gosh.\n"
"* I really wanna give him a hug right now."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/3/2}* Yeah, we should TOTALLY squeeze the life outta him later!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/4/5/0}* ..."
msgstr ">{#k/4/5/0}* ..."

msgid ">{#k/5/8}* Catty, no!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/0/0}* Hey, there's no need to be afraid of him."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/0/1}* Yeah, he's WAY too adorable for that."
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/5/1}* Way too adorable!"
msgstr ""

msgid ">{#k/0/0}* Hey, I'm sure he'll understand why you did what you did."
